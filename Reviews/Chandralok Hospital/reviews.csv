1 star,"Dr. Asmit Vaidya is good at what he does and gave appropriate and efficient treatment to my mother, but the staff and nurses are horrendous, extremely rude and ill mannered.

The general ward needs better maintenance and cleanliness. The hospital fees are too high for the lack of service provided. "

Hospital is on main road and convenient for people. "
5 stars,"My Uncle was admitted in Chandralok Hospital due to COVID. He required ICU, oxygen and ventilator. Dr. Asmit Vaidya and staff are experienced and my Uncle recovered very well. This is a very good and reliable hospital. "
2 stars,Doctor is very good. Effective diagnosis and cure and would hv given 4 stars but It takes a very very long time for each petiant and you have to wait for hours. Its good that doctor takes time to see every patient and doesnt hurry but its really too much of time and should keep short time so other unwell patients do no suffer waiting for hours for their turn. Just a suggestion.

1 star,"In the month of April (2021) my mother was suffering from covid-19 we family admitted her in Chandralok hospital then they asked for plasma and medicine and injections we also gave them immediately but they didn't have the ventilator (for oxygen supply) required for the patient as a result one May In the afternoon my mother's oxygen level came down to 45.. she was panting a lot.. the staff were telling you to shift your patient to a hospital with a ventilator bed... but the hospital doctor didn't even come to see Asmit Vaidya. During the wave, we could not get ventilator beds anywhere in Pune city that day. Finally at 8:30 pm a bed was arranged in ESI hospital but this doctor did not even provide a stretcher to the patient and we shifted our patient from this hospital to ESI hospital in a very poor arrangement. Due to her condition, she was fighting death for the next eight days..Finally on May 9, 2021, she breathed her last. The profession of doctor is considered very sacred. We put a lot of faith in them and in this time of calamity we believe that they are God and indeed angels are real...but after seeing the way this hospital is run, I just want to say that I lost my mother.
So henceforth citizens of Bibvewadi area should never go to this hospital.Basically they are also suspicious about their blood test lab.The indifference shown to us when the patient was in critical condition caused us to lose our mother. It is earnest not to. "
