1 star,It will be a great mistake if someone goes to this hospital. Fully commercial and they want only to make money. In BICU room everywhere you will find cockroaches and zero hygiene. For general ward for 3 days I had to spend 72000. And they told even doctor will not visit still consultation charges will be charged. It's like a monopoly they are running. Nonsense hospital and it's not a hospital it's a commercial institute. Doctors also like that and. Supporting in looting people. U go for heart issue they will do eye to ear all test and charge u. For money being charged atleast they should have maintained hygiene that also these people are not capable of. Don't ever go to this hospital.

Suggestions:-
1) Provide standard medical mask (use and throw type) to all staff.This is to show hospital commitment to protect their employees health and also it will give good impression to patient family about hospital commitment to prevent spread of disease.
2) Provide dedicated Bins to collect waste masks
3) Patient information board at entrance not updated
4) Account staff sitting place is very very congested which can impact their productivity and difficult for us to approach their office (No place for even standing) "

1 star,"Have been admitted here since past 3 days. Have undergone various tests for no reasons. With all test reports negative. Even after this hospital being a multi diagnostics, they have been unable to diagnose the disease. After two days of recovery from all the symptoms, I have not been given a discharge yet. I am not on medication since past two days and feeling completely ok, even then I am asked to stay for ""observation"". Yet nobody has actually observed. There are no proper timings of doctors visit. There is a new doctor at every visit. They ask how are you feeling. and that's that. They say they have some policy to discharge after 2pm. I have had the worst experience here. Once they get to know you have a mediclaim, they make you believe that you need to be hospitalized, they give you a long list of tests to be done. Worst experience. I would not recommend this hospital. "

1 star,"Strictly not recommended at all .
1) Staff is not well trained and unprofessional.
2) Associate doctors are visiting patient without even prior checking patient case paper and asking patient themselves that you are diabetic and high BP issue right ? Giving  random conclusions ,🤔 . Associate doctors are good for nothing and without knowledge.They don't even give attention to what Dr Pawar has instructed to them. Dr. Rati is most arrogant senseless associate doctor over there who tried to bullied me when I asked her about lapse of my patient case paper .
3) Unlike other good practice hospitals here you will find that staff is completely unaware of patient information and ask patient himself that when is your operation is planned ? at what time etc? And you need to follow up continusly to get process done.
3) Operation theatre is most dirty space with no ventilation , dust everywhere, torned out operation theatre mattress and they don't even switch on AC in Operation theatre until doctor Pawar step in .
4) Though they charge equivalent or more than top hospitals in pune but services are nowhere upto the mark.
5) Hygiene & sanitization is not good at all.
6) Patient case papers are mishandled and lapsed . "

1 star,"Worst Worst and such a Painful experience I had there on Last Sunday, I have taken my wife there , she was continuously doing vomiting and severe headache, These guys admitted her and even after 18 hours, her condition getting worst, these guys just simply giver saline after saline(around 8-9 saline). They couldn't stop her vomiting in 18 hours, then what kind of doctors are there.(This is I am saying after she got treated just in half hour in another hospital, she hasn't that some major problem that should have taken that much time)

On the top of that they were not discharging her saying that there billing person is not present, We had taken lot of effort, get rid of these people.

Later I called my friends get out her from there and put it her to another nearby hospital, There in just half hours vomiting stopped and we got her discharge from there in 36 hours.

Later I realized on Sunday there main doctor(Dr Pawar) was not present and other docs don't have any Idea what to do, So they were trying push it next morning with put saline after saline.

Staff are rude only the one reception guy(Harshad) was good, rest doctor also irritating.

And People who are thinking that they have good rating, check the rating comment people have put it, it's self marketing, same type of comment.

I was drawn to there rating, can't trust google ratings also these days. "

1 star,"Worst place to get treatment. I was suffering from intense fever, headache stomach cramps etc. Symptoms were indicating Maleria or dengue. Thus On the name of dr. pawar, dr. Shilpa consulted me and suggested blood and urine test on 6 pm OPD. According to her tests take about 1 hour. Receptionist Sarika dhamale was unable to identity test names clearly written and also tests were not found in their software. Thus she confirmed with dr. shilpa and lab assistant deepak again and again for atleast 15 min. Finally handwritten receipt was given and told us to collect report at 9:30 pm as per confirmation with mr. Deepak. When we try to collect report at 9.30 pm man on reception counter arrogantly said that report are not ready and it is not time to collect reports. After this dr. Shilpa told us blood test was done in 5 min and it shows normal, urine test reports will be ready next day. Its was fake tale by her to just clam us down and medicine was given on trial & error basis.Being 24*7 care hospital, Pawar hospital was unable to test blood and urine in same day & give proper medicines due to inactiveness and careless behavior of staff. Suffered unnecessary for extra time due to such ridiculous treatment. I'll never recommend treatment at Pawar hospital. "

1 star,"In this hospital, for a post, e.g Pharmacist, they select the candidate based on his appearance, not that knowledge and skill. They want the candidate to look good and slim. If he is not like that, then they tell the candidate how you are. I would like to suggest that they should mention this in their manual, for any post of hospital duty, candidate must be slim figure, fair in look.
Please do not insult the candidate by offering job. "
