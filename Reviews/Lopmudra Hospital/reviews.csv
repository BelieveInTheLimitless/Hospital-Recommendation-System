1 star,"I visited with my wife who was not keeping well. I had taken an appointment of Dr. Avdhut G Bodamwad from Practo. What a pathetic experience it was. Apart from being unprofessional, the staff was clueless about the doctor‚Äôs whereabouts. We waited for the doctor for 35 mins.
Moreover, the replacement general physician that they were talking about with us was not present in the hospital. When he appeared (the replacement general physician) he was reluctant to see us. And arguing with the staff. I strongly not recommend this hospital and doctor. Don‚Äôt waste your time going there. "
5 stars,She was came in very bad condition.Emergency first aid was given at the earliest proper counselling was done to make the patient feel better. The hospital staff was good. Hospitality was excellent.Must visit the hospital for all the service‚Äôs. 
5 stars,"Dr Avdhut sir is Very knowledgeable Doctor. Doesn't rush u for unnecessary treatment, procedures or tests. Puts in effort and time to hear and understand your current medical situation, carefully reviews your medical history, carefully examines you physically and then suggests treatment without giving additional unnecessary medicines.
He explains the situation, course of action and logic behind the same in detail, very calmly, without giving u tension about ur health. That itself makes you feel confident and starts healing you.
I would definitely recommend visiting him for consultation @ Lopmudra Hospital, Pashan Sus road. "
