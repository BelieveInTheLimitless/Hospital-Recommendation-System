4 stars,"Visited twice for Mother & Son treatment. Both times it was a night emergency.
Every staff member from security guards, receptionist nurses, doctors is so helpful and cooperative.

Only pharmacists need to improve. The lady was so busy to check their system issue and kept us waiting for long. After work was done she was busy with her personal call...! "
5 stars,"Good Hospital . Good People

Had visited Hospital for Covid vaccination.  Found it very neat and clean and understood it offers various treatments.
Best wishes to staff and management. "
1 star,"I visited the hospital for my  kid who felt down with weakness with mild fever as complain.
Guys I would like to warn to all my friends whoever is reading post, the doctor hospitalized her for 1 day and Billed for ~50k. Doctor had asked for verious list of tests and even then also they couldn't identify the simple viral fever.  We realised the situation and forced us  for discharge.

Junior doctor was so pathetic and lazy, who didn't visit to room even for checkul. Its just sisters who took care of my kid. Many thanks to those sisters.

Doctor even didn't listen initially to us, treating us like uneducated and God to himself.

Where another doctor from a clinic cured my kid just in one day, identified the reason without any test by symptoms based on experience.

I strongly advise to take a second openion before visiting to hospital. "
2 stars,"If you have emergency please don't visit this hospital. When you visit the hospital make sure to carry a adharcard Xerox and a pen. Because they are not going help even with a pen.

Visited on 6th nov. I don't like the service at all. The receptionist is arrogant. And not at all supportive. There is three chairs in the reception but one person is there. And she is extremely slow in her work. I wait in the line for more than 30mins. Only 3 persons are there infront of me.

About Pathology lab, Dipti and Vijay are there. Who work according to their mood. For RTPCR they gave you 3 page of form and all of them have the same details only. After filling all the form you have to wait for again more then 30mins as they with start the test when there more than 5 patients atleast. So make sure take 3-4 friends with you when you go for any test here. If you are alone it will take atleast an hour.

With the same hand glove she do RTPCR of 6 people. So think how safe is this place for COVID free.

At your risk you can visit this hospital. But I am not recommending it to anyone till the COVID is there. "
5 stars,"I visited this hospital for my daughter's treatment. And I must say this is one of the really good hospital, in all aspects. Staff, nurses and all are so cooperative,take the best care of patients. You don't need to run behind them instead you ring a bell and within a minute or two, they will be there for assistance. Hospital charges are nominal and provide really good service. They also provide food for patients. This is runs by Poonawala and its charitable hospital. "

1 star,The worst experience! Don't recommend this to anyone. Slow process of hospital and lack of attention given to the patient disappointed me a lot. The hospital is Money oriented and they do not even have a proper canteen plus staff is arrogant and not supportive at all. 
1 star,"I admitted my mom 2 months ago for fever, Dr. Yadav and a/c dept executive said approx 25k cost for 3-4 days including medicines. Dr. didn't discharge after getting well in 3 days, he was focusing for commission only. 4th day a/c executive said bill is 73k, stop all services. Meanwhile On Dr. suggestions, their executive take my mom to Noble hospital for CT scan for 2 subject, I paid 14k for it. I cleared all my bill at the time of discharge, on demanding CT scan Report, they said to collect from Noble hospital and Noble hospital said we are not your billing hospital, collect all report from viloo poonawala hospital where you have paid. Nurse Kavita said that their executive will collect from Noble hospital and will inform you to collect it, Still not getting mom reports in almost 2 months after several visits and follow ups. No one is transferring calls to Dr or management.
#Ipaid#IwantRepot

Kash! negative reviews ka option hota. Never go in VilooPoonawala hospital "
1 star,"Doctor insist to admit in icu without  knowing  illness, when Asked Doc says only icu nurses care patient. They charge any amount for anything without informing. Doctors are always focus on their commission, nurses always argu I admitted my mom 2 months ago, i cleared all bill, still not getting ct scan report after several visits and follow up for it. Their nurses/executive say to collect from Noble, noble exec say to collect from billing hospital viloo poonawala. #WorstExperience "
4 stars,Cleanliness and staff behavior at its best... We have taken covishiled waxin here and they were supportive.. 
5 stars,"I had a history of kidney stones and it was creating trouble. I had to go through ureteroscopy done by Dr. Kshitij Raghuwanshi.
Still in recovery process but I am happy with the treatment I got. Specially Doctor is very polite and friendly, staff as well. Every time I visit for follow-ups they listen my issue very calmly and then answer it.
I would strongly recommend this hospital for any problem related to urology. Plus point is that it is a little pocket friendly as well. "
1 star,"I admited my wife in this hospital , after operation my wife need rest but the staff give admission to kids in the ladies ward, all day and night kids cry loudly , if you realy need rest please don't come to poonawala hospital.. "
5 stars,"This is very good and ethical hospital in Hadapsar, Pune. They have very professional doctors and equipped with All the required facilities. I had a great experience while undergoing with my critical surgery.

For my Son’s hospitalisation I suggested on few improvement areas. They took it very seriously and responded on high priority. My experience is impressive and best in class. I got extremely swift and positive response from trustee and immediate resolutions from COO.

I wish all the best and really appreciate the way you people are working. "
5 stars,"My son was hospitalized for high fever with all the blood investigations reports done. Dr. Mayur Agrawal was treating my son who is most skilled pediatrician, we are extremely satisfied by his treatment and consultation. Cleanliness is the key factor of this hospital, patient feels like home. Housekeeping staff was very prompt.
Improvement areas:
Admission process is little bit slow.
Promptness lacking in some of the nursing staffs. "
2 stars,"Had my Covishield vaccine booster dose  recently at this hospital. It wasn't good experience, the way it was administered. Govt/Corpn Hospitals do much better. "
1 star,Very expensive.For sanitizer also they charged 300 rs .They are running big hospital but not able to provide sanitizer they charged 300 for that but not used in the room.Doctors are very good .Poor nursing they pitched the 3 years  baby for 6 times for nerve without supervision...Too much problem i faced there .Even if you have mediclaim .They will charge you with this that expenses of 6000-7000 ...I just recommend for good doctor and treatment but if you admit they will charge you for silly things ..Hygiene and Clean is very good.By seeing Tag line Ethic and affordable don't fall into that trap.They will loot you like anything..

1 star,"Very bad experince
if you have cashless policy please don't go to this hospital.
It took almost 9 hours for dischage a patient. "
5 stars,"I would like to specially thank the following hospital staff:-
Dr. Mane – Dr. Mane would check in on me at regular intervals on the first night of admission which was the hardest night of my stay at Villoo Poonawalla Memorial Hospital. From monitoring of my blood pressure to regularly checking on my fever every few hours, Dr. Mane showed extreme ability to take decisions according to the need of the situation. A very jovial doctor who always gave a positive vibe and showed great responsibility. She would always go out of her way to make me feel comfortable during this hard time of mine. She was very good with my son Shiv also who is a very difficult person.
Dr. Firdaus & Dr. Shravasti Walde both very capable doctors who showed very high levels of professionalism and adaptability depending the situation they were placed in. Both have very positive attitudes which would keep any patient calm in their situation.
Many thanks to Dr. Sandeep (who has a very positive attitude towards all situations and who was very good with my son) and Dr Pooja (who was there at the time of my admission and very quick admission!)
Sister Supriya Shinde – Sister Supriya would come and check on my son and me at different times. She is a very warm and child friendly individual. She was wonderful at drawing my child’s blood and kept him very calm and comfortable. A very, warm, calm and soft-spoken individual who set very high standards of professionalism.
Sister Afsana Sheikh– Sister Afsana attended to me on the first night which was the hardest night of my stay. She also attended to all my medical needs on various days during my stay. A very patient individual and very capable she would always attend to removal and re attachment of my drip multiple times and as and when required. A very calm individual she handled all situations with maturity.
Sister Vrushali Ganguly – Sister Vrushali was responsible for changing my IV tap from my right hand to my left arm between the elbow and my wrist. The entire experience was absolutely painless and the new tap was attached without any movement on my arm which enabled me to sleep much better at nights and less uncomfortable when attaching and removing the IV line. Her technique of blood removal was also painless. A very positive and capable nurse.
Sister Kishori was a very calm and positive. Her blood drawing techniques was absolutely painless. She was always prompt and had a very positive attitude to all situations. She was very good with my son Shiv who was also admitted at the same time for dengue fever. A very patient individual she always showed responsibility, professionalism and could deal very well with whichever situation she was put in.
Sister Amruta – A very soft-spoken individual she was very calm, professional and showed extreme capability in dealing with my son. Her blood drawing technique was also painless.
The house keeping staff were very professional and kept the premises clean at all times. They were also very courteous and timely in getting all their chores and responsibilities completed. Amongst them Nilesh Shelke was very focused on the day I was admitted. He had given me 3 cold water sponges in the first night which was instrumental in keeping my fever in control. He was always there to attend to me as and when required especially on the first night of admission which was very critical. I would also like to point out the Jaalinder kept the premises very clean and was always made the bed with complete perfection. It actually seemed that when he made the bed it was as if he was wrapping a gift with wonderful precision.
I would like to thank all the staff at the hospital who were very capable and outstanding in their roles. They displayed great standards of professionalism, responsibility and made a very difficult and challenging experience much much easier. "
5 stars,"Very cooperative staff, good health care facilities "
5 stars,"A routine pre employment checkup went off very well and the staff there were very quick and efficient in their work. Two desks set up outside , one for a self declaration on the health status and the other for entering you your details into the system. The reception had adequately marked social distancing markers on the floor  and the staff made sure they were quick. The x-ray section is one floor below . The entire place smelled comfortingly of sanitiser and soap which was reassuring.The x ray technician was very good at his job and quick in his actions. The Covid19 test area in front of the main gate down the ramp was set up well. The space between the chairs placed outside was adequate to stay safe. The medical personnel were outfitted well and the tests were conducted professionally. I was impressed by the overall intent and focus on doing thier job well. "
1 star,"Went after appointment, but no doctors were present on the day. Neither Gynecologist came nor Pediatrician. Receptionists are very slow in her work. She took 15 min to inform me charges for Doppler and USG . Next day when I actually went there she told very high charges . I informed yesterday she gave different charges. "
5 stars,"Proper treatment & counseling. Clean & Healthy food serv. Well & good housekeeping. Helpfull & caring staff.
Easily available all treatments everytime. "

5 stars,"My wife was admitted for treatment of Covid 19 and low haemoglobin. The hospital has a very good team of doctors, nursing and admin. The nursing staff always used to joke and smile to keep our spirits high. The hospital staff despite of being under tremendous stress and pressure due to a nationwide surge of the pandemic were able to correctly diagnose and treat her with just the right amount of medicines. We are forever grateful to the doctors, nursing and admin staff for their ability to remain calm and work under such trying and testing times. Inspite of most of the staff being hospitalized themselves due to the pandemic, all patients have been treated well and have left the hospital hale and hearty. Kudos to the team of Villoo Poonawalla Memorial Hospital. God bless you all. "
5 stars,"Excellent Staff at the hospital. Took such great care of us and refused any tips from anybody.

We are extremely obliged and have so much gratitude towards everyone who took care of my husband and me in the 8 days we were here.

Thank you from the bottom of our heart.
The staff was always available and never complained inspite of so much pressure always. They had plenty people working throughout the day for every task.

We had about 10 staff taking care of us through morning and night shifts and wach one always walked into the room with smiles and jokes to keep our spirits high.

We are forever grateful and would like to wish the team all the best for all their future.

In times like Covid when you are away from hohr family, having hospital staff that stayed with you and made you feel he away from home is rare.

Thank you to the team at #VillooPoonawallaMemorialHospital. "
5 stars,"First of all, my sincere thanks to all staff (Doctor/Administration/Management/Security, etc.) of Villoo Poonawalla Memorial Hospital. Words are not enough to praise. Recently my brother got treatment from this hospital. I am sharing my experience on the basis of that. They are working very sincerely and managing all the patients very well. Each and every person gave proper guidance in their department so that patients get better treatment. Key points to highlight are good medical treatment/services, good management, good hygiene/cleanliness and good food. Everyone speaks with respect and dignity. They are really staying true to their tagline ""Ethical and Affordable"". "
1 star,"Very Bad experience. The staff was purely money minded. For even telling the doctor's name they tell you to first pay money. The doctor then gives you a list of tests to be done. The staff then tells you to pay for the tests before performing them. If you don't pay for tests beforehand, they don't conduct the tests and keep you waiting.
I advise everyone  to never visit this hospital. "

1 star,Reception department is always clueless on doctors and timing. More over the coordination lacks highly amount the front staff. Worse experience during raining time. 
5 stars,Good competent staff ..got my father's tendon tear correction surgery done and claim process was handled very conveniently and staff was very courteous and caring. 
1 star,"Tag line is Ethical & Affordable - Neither the doctors or staff are ethical, nor it is so affordable. Too costly and massive error during bill generation. I would not suggest anyone to go there for a check-up as they will catch you and will admit you. Even while relieving also they will take up the whole day to complete the discharge formalities. During the entire admit period the file was not shown to me and even the regular test results was shown to any of my family members. Even the visiting doctors don't have any idea about what patient is suffering from. Everything is hidden to everyone. The staff was not so active in the night due to which I faced too many problems in the night. Very bad experience in my life. "
3 stars,"Staff in hospital is very polite and friendly. But doctors are not available all the time. Specially MD doctors are not available all the time .
They don't let the person with patient to come inside with patient while meeting doctor, this is one of biggest con.
They provide pohe and unhealthy stuff in breakfast to patients.
Infrastructure and staff is perfect. "
5 stars,"I really have so much to say for Villoo Poonawala hospital.
Everytime that i visit the hospital,  i have received the best care. Waiting time is negligible.
The doctors are amazing and so are the technicians,  nurses as well as caretakers.
Billing is smooth too and the billing staff are very helpful.
Very clean hospital with competant staff.
I prefer this hospital for myself as well as my family and friends. "
5 stars,"Couldn't ask for anything better in such a situation. The villoo poonawalla memorial hospital, Pune was the answer to all our questions. The way the team treated us even in this pandemic was beyond perfect. Got my wife admitted on 13th of April owing to her deteriorating health because of Covid. The doctors were extremely patient and caring . I mean before we had only read about how amazing this hospital is but the recent experience made us believe in all that we had heard. I want to specially thank Dr Gurbir S Chowdhary (Medical director of The Poonawala Hospital) , Dr. Shalini Singh ( my wife's attending doctor) and the wonderful team of nurses who were always there for us. Its because of their constant support she is all well and healthy now. We are truely indebted.
Warm regards

4 stars,"It is a great hospital. Doctors, nurses and all the staff are nice and take good care of the patients and are punctual. The hospital is clean.
The only drawback is of canteen. The food is not good and should at least provide good tea or coffee.
The hospital can also add a flowers shop to give to patients. "
5 stars,We got my brother in law treated here for covid. Th staff is very warm and professional. We understand that in these tough times all our medical professionals are over streched but this doesn't show in thier behaviour or attitude. A huge Kudos to the entire floor staff and the in-charge Mrs. Rekha Pawar. 
5 stars,"Hospitalization of a family member is one thing that gets stress onto our minds. However at Villoo Poonawalla Memorial Hospital we had a very good experience during our visit. The services provided by doctors, nurses,dietician and housekeeping staff was very time to time. The hospital is very clean and on the hygiene factor is absolutely great.
Thank you very much to each one who helped us as the hospital. "
5 stars,"Due to my family negligence we were left hospital hunting in pune for a bed for a relative. The suitation to get a bed was real and bad.
This was at 1am all the running.
Villo Poonwalla was the only hospital that accepted him and started all the necessary formalities that were required.
The next three days was crazy as till then we had no idea that my relative was covid positive and not just the BP problem, he is a senior citizen. The hospital took care of everything very professionally. The nurse , doctor, brothers and security also helped in.
Thank you Dr Yadav in ER for taking us in and caring. "
4 stars,"My son was admitted for dengue fever. Hospital services are good. Doctors, nurses and all other staff are good, especially ICU service was up to the mark.
Suggestion :-  request to increase nursing staff during night duty. "
1 star,"I visited the hospital for my  kid who felt down with weakness with mild fever as complain.
Guys I would like to warn to all my friends whoever is reading post, the doctor hospitalized my kid for 1 day and Billed for ~50k. Doctor had asked for verious list of tests and even then also they couldn't identify the simple viral fever.  We realised the situation and forced us  for discharge.

Junior doctor was so pathetic and lazy, who didn't visit to room even for checkul. Its just sisters who took care of my kid. Many thanks to those sisters.

Where another doctor from a clinic cured her just in one day, identified the reason without any test by symptoms based on experience.

I strongly advise to take a second openion before visiting to hospital. "
1 star,"Worst experience. For backpain due to improper sleep position also Doctor asked for X-ray and D3/B12 test. For every visit, Doctor is asking for D3/B12 test. totally disappointed. People cant get any shoulder pain or back pain for that doctors ask for so many test instead of giving pin killer medicine. Pathetic hospital and doctors too. Spent 1000 rupees and not a single tablet he gave then really have to think before going any hospital and doctors too. Do I need to perform D3/B12 test for every 6 month. I never saw this approach any were... "
5 stars,"Very efficient and well-managed hospital. Clean toilets in visitors/OPD section, helpful staff and prompt service. "
5 stars,"This is the best hospital in Pune. Clean tidy and a very peaceful site. The rooms are very well maintained and at affordable rates. They really live up to their word in terms of the services rendered. Just got a treatment from them on one of the critical diseases and I would like to mention a few names for ensuring the smoother recovery of my health Dr. Romesh Yadav for his consultation, Dr. V. Mane and Dr. Walde for keeping me posted on how I progress.

Thanks to Sr.  Kavita, Sr. Kishori, Sr. Vrushali, Sr. Afsana and Sr Alka. All the support staff for taking care of the hygiene factors at all times.

Last but not the least special thanks to the management Dr. Arya and Dr. Chowdhary for ensuring smooth functioning of the hospital. "
5 stars,Excellent experience from the Dr and from Nurse. Nice and friendly environment. They took very good care of my brother. Medical Bill is also affordable and gave discount on medical bill and same is mentioned on final bill. Overall very good experience. 
5 stars,"For Covid vaccine, the place is good. As like every other place in Pune, appointments don't matter, you just need the sms of registration.
Token to be taken first and one can wait in the designated waiting area. The staff is very cooperative. Cash payment. "
5 stars,"Recently myself, my mother, brother in law, father in law got covid positive. Except my mother we three were under home isolation.
Mother was admit and we were helpless.
It was the entire hospital staff ( all doctors, admin, lab technicians, nurse and support staff ) that come to our rescue. Especially to mention Mrs.Rekhatai Pawar - incharge nurse covid ward, who served like a family member.
We were able to fight corona only with support of these god gifted persons.
Beyond the tagline ' ethical & affordable ', I will say this hospital is place gifted by GOD to human to fight and win the battle.
Thanks to Villoo Poonawala Team once again.

5 stars,"Hospital is very good. Staff is very cooperative. Cleaning of premises is very very good.
Canteen facilities should be improved.
No proper ventilation for the relative waiting area room . No place to escape the smell spread inside the room. "
5 stars,"I would personally like to rate Villoo Poonawalla Hospital as #1 in Pune owing to my personal experience.

I underwent hemithyroidectomy 10 days ago in this hospital and my experience with all the team members was beyond my expectations.
The employees are very professional and customer oriented ,doctors are par excellence and the facilities in the hospital are superb.

Could not have expected anything better!

A hospital engaging in ethical practices is what we need.

A special note of thanks to my treating doctors -Dr Romesh Yadav, Dr Manohar and Dr Dipanjali! "
5 stars,"“I have gone to Gynecologist Doctors Anand Shinde for a couple Months for my wife

1 star,"Doctor insist to admit without letting know the patient the cause of disease or illness, when Asked Doc says... ""don't think we are asking you to admit for money""... bad ethics :-( "
5 stars,"Excellent Services Provided by Hospital .
Hospital Staff is amazing , specially the nursing staff in General Ward lead by Rekha Sister , Madhuri Sister and also Doctor Komal Bhadu provided special assistance when ever needed.
Administration is also very good, highly recommended . "
1 star,"Poor experience.
If you are frontline worker, then do not go for COVID vaccination. They simply reject your registration having said that can not get details from database (government database) for frontline worker vaccinated earlier. "
5 stars,"Consulted the doctors in this hospital and felt like, this is the best of the best hospital. The doctors are so kind, experts and most experienced especially Dr. Kiran Shah for Gen. Medicine and Dr. Dhobade, a Urologist. Staff is also so cordial and kind hearted. The consultation charge is not high but it's medium. "
1 star,"I would have given 0 or negative stars because of the staff's behavior with patient but google is not allowing that. one thing is that this place is more interested in money than a convenience of the patient. On top of that they do not provide your case papers to you, so if you are going to some other city or place, start from scratch. Also if you need a certificate of the procedure done on you, then you need to pay more for that. "
4 stars,"Quite GOOD experience with overall patient's medical & nursing care.  Not only Physicians & Specialists, but nursing staff & rest of the hosp management team is very co-operative & well disciplined. I am thankful to the Hospital for efficient & timely treatment & care of my 92year old grandmother suffering from ischemic stroke. "
1 star,I was registered at this hospital for covaxin at 8am and was told the vaccination will be administered at 9.15 am. After waiting till 9.30 am a gentleman who calls himself a marketing head arrives declaring only second dose will be administered to those who have their first dose with villo poonawala. On asking he tells me that they have only covishield and not covaxin!!! He being the marketing head knows everything about the vaccine!!! Isn't it his duty to inform the availability before registration. Myself being a healthcare worker was running from pillar to post for my second dose and the  the marketing head handles things unprofessionally and rudely!!! 
5 stars,"VPMH is one of the best hospital care centers in Pune with its genuinely nursing services, care and treatment facilities, which holds very true to their slogan ""ethical and affordable care"". Patients here are in highly expert hands of Doctors staff including Dr Kiran Shah, Dr Romesh Yadav, Dr Mahesh Brahmankar, Dr Colonel Choudhary and the in-house residents along with all the nursing staffs for their ethical, high quality care, perfection in diagnosis and treatment line. Hospital is quite well managed and equipped in terms of administrative services and standards in the City. Healing the sick with care is actually visible in this hospital which is a great attribute.

It was this team who made our patient breathe again. We are so thankful of the hospital for saving our patient's life. Our blessings will remain for the hospital and its hardworking staff for ever. 
5 stars,"My honest review based on my experience for my mothers chemotherapy.
I would appreciate Dr shree, Dr shsna nag, Dr brahbankar, Mam supriya chabukswar and sister vrushali for their best cooperation and utmost supervision.
Hospital charges were comparatively less than other hospitals.

However, after going through other reviews i feel there shall be improvement in related areas.

MANY THANKS TO Resp. ADAR POONAWALA FOR HIS VITAL INITIATIVE. 🙏 "
1 star,Most pathetic hospital experience I ever had. They know  to well  how to play with the patience level of patients as well as relative. Please never ever visit this hospital again. They are running money minting machine in the name of hospital. You need to sit to collect one simple death summary for decade because the doctor will say they need to consult with consultant to prepare the same. There are many such incidents. For more details follow my tweet to Adar poonawala in my tweeter handle #pranjit parasar 
4 stars,Came for health checkup through Sadhana Sahakari Bank. Hospital service is very good and prompt. Staff behaviour as well as instruments provided is good. Hospital is very clean and hygiene. Thanks.

1 star,Low Class lab facilities covid 19 report after 3 to 5 day's very poor management.They don't have own pathalogy lab for testing rtpcr.Depend on third party. Own Experience & based on hospital primises observation 
1 star,"Such a weired experience, was admitted due to fever. They were not able to find root cause neither were giving medicine to lower the fever. I had to ask for discharge and that too was painful and unprofessional behaviour from Dr.They didn't suggest any medicine. Same day ,i went to other Dr and felt better after medication.
This hospital fails even in there slogan itself that it is ethical.

Really feel bad to see today's Dr attitude "
5 stars,"I was admitted in this hospital. All the facilities of hospital are excellent. Staff behaviour is good. Homely environment. Thanks.
Suggestion - Hospital should start cashless facility on name of Villoo Poonawalla Hospital itself. "
5 stars,"It is always tension free once the patient is under care of Dr. Kiran Shah. The hospital is well equipped, good staff, clean environment and affordable. At last thanks to Mr. Poonawala funding Welfare foundation. "
5 stars,"One of the best multi-speciality hospital.
Hospital environment is totally good,

5 stars,Really very well team of doctors and staff during the time of pandemic also they taking care of other patients so well. Thankyou for ur service Mr and Mrs Poonawalla. Doing great work. 
1 star,"1) Their tagline says ""affordable"" -- trust me it's most expensive than any Class-A hospital. More than Columbia & Nobel. Compare prices before admit yourself.
2) In name they have mentioned ""charitable hospital"" - it seems like they have decided to change definition of word ""charity"" charging double. if you want to confirm just ask for delivery changes & compare, you will be shocked....Morel of the story is i can't give -5 star so I have to give 1, but beware of such hospitals. Stay away from such a money makers. "

3 stars,"As good as Dr Kiranshah, Dr Kshitij, the attending junior doctors and staff of the ward are as careless and poor. If you yourself are not careful, then your case % is going to deteriorate depending on the ward staff.
Even if your open surgery doctor does well, but there is no hearing in the ward. Most of the ward boys, nurses, attending doctors are irresponsible.
No care, no cooperation, no responsibility, nothing, nothing. "
