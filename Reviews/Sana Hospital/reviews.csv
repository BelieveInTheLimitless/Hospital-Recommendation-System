1 star,"The worst, most nasty admin / reception.

The doctors and testing facilities are really, really basic, but good and they charge really less... A couple of years back, I had gone there for a broken finger... and I really had a wonderful experience.

And now I thought I'd go there for some GI distress I've been having. The reception staff don't even understand basic medical conditions. They don't even know if they have specialists for this conditions. And if you ask to speak to the GP or a senior (when convenient, of course), they simply refuse. I've been trying for 2 weeks now. And if you ask for their name, so you can follow-up, they lie and give any random name. They don't do their job despite multiple requests. They're the kind of people who seem to take joy from others' distress, suffering and frustration.

This hospital could be such a huge blessing, but if the first point of contact of the hospital are so nasty, lazy and shameless.... how do we as people, get through to the doctors and care we need?

It's a real shame. "
5 stars,"The best hospital in this area
Value for money
Treatment is also good "
1 star,"I got my Acl surgery done from this hospital and they should have started my physiotherapy immediately in about two days. When I asked them, they told me the physiotherapist didn't come to work. And they discharged me without giving any physiotherapy protocal. They didn't even tell me that I was supposed to start immediately or I could've found a physiotherapist to help.  Because of this my recovery got delayed and I am behind my recovery schedule by 2 weeks. It made my leg weaker. I don't recommend this hospital at all. "
1 star,Worst hospital.. receptionist s behavior is very cheap.. battameez lady.. and reports never come proper dey don't hv facilities.. my worst experience 
1 star,Dr. Suhail  he is worst doctor i have ever met. He doesn't have any knowledge and cannot diagnose properly. He doesn't even listen to his patient carefully. He is very careless and a worst doctor i would never recommend anybody to go in sana hospital because there is no proper doctor or staff to deal with patient. I wish i could give 0 but i don't have the option.He even doesn't provide any direction at all and upon asking he doesn't respond in a good way. He is very unprofessional.

1 star,"Worst experience
Very unhygenic
At bill counter while discharge the prescrition was exchanged with another patient and when i confirmed once again as my mothers name was not showing on that then they were awake and gave the correct priscription so this means the patient needs to be vigilent and not a single word of apology from their end
So sad "

5 stars,"Had met Dr. Suhel Khan in 2016 for my ankle fracture and ligament tear. I was cured with his treatment. Few days back my Mom had an wrist injury. We took her to Dr. Suhel Khan. He got her Operated for wrist dislocation. Found Dr. Suhel Khan very genuine and polite person who makes patient and their relatives understand the concern towards their treatment and health.
Would like thank Dr. Suhel Khan and the whole staff of Sana hospital for the care and support they gave my Mom.
May Swt Allah bless you abundantly Suhel Sir.
Thank you once again. ðŸ˜Š "

3 stars,"Hospital is ok, My cousin had a dangue and had to spend 3 days at Sana Hospital and recovered very well. He is gracefully okay now but the staff of nurses and cleanliness is that much appreciated. I had to request them multiple times to clean up the floor and they hardly bother about it. I saw 2 doctors visiting everyday in the morning amd evening. General Ward isnâ€™t worth â‚¹1800 they charge for 24 hours. "

1 star,"One of the worst services ever.....the hospital gates are even closed at 8 am and because of it no one can come and visit the relativs admitted in hospital.......also the doctor's daily checkup is pretty late around 8 or 9pm (after his OPD which is disgusting ).... the medical is not trained....and is not hygienic......they literally kept the used syringe lying on a bed which is harmful....and the money you pay for private rooms are not worth it , they are very small....and the private room I visited had a very dirty toilet...Very bad experience "
