1 star,This pmc hospital is not working properly becaune of his officers . I was tried to get treatment from that hospital but they was not responded properly.  They are trying to give the wrong information to patients that when who is trying to get treatment at time of 2.00 pm they are always saying come after 3.00 pm . But when I was asked the information about lunch time they are not giving the exact time. This is the fraud to every common puneri people ... take it seriously. .
