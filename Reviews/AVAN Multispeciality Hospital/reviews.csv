3 stars,"It's multi speciality hospital having almost all facilities under one roof but lags in experienced doctors,no regular doctor is here with good practice "
2 stars,"Not recommended to anyone. I went here 4 times from March as I was having thorat infection. Trainee doctors checked and prescribed me medicine after 2 days I got fever and went to the hospital at this time so called MD was there without even checking me he suggested to get hospitalized. For 4 days theycharged 38000 of which 4900 rs are administration charges in such rural area,
throat infection was not completely healed when asked doctor said it will take time to heal. I was ok with that as fever was relieved,

2 months l sustained the infection but this time it got worst, same throat infection but with no fever, went there he prescribed 5 day b12 injection and medicine, next after dose I got fever,
Mild Fever was there now. Now again went to hospital OPD was open doctor was busy playing games or chatting waited 35 mins looked at receptionist then she understood and told doctor to check patients, doctor without even looking at my throat or checking my temperature suggests so casually to mi to get hospitalized. I have no symptoms of covid no cold  no respiratory problem at all. When asked for other solution doctor tells to remove tonsils. So this is the multispecialist hospital. Just please do go to these money suckers. "
