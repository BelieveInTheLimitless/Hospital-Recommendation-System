1 star,Very bad experience I had around 5 years ago .. hospital took around 10k rs for admitting my grandmother for only 1 hr.. compounder took advantage of our poor knowledge about hospitals and its charges … my grand mother is no more but whenever I travel from Sinhagad road It reminds me of fraud I experienced.. lots of curse to doctor .. 
5 stars,Good results 
5 stars,None
