4 stars,"I have nothing but words of praise for Dr. Ramesh Kering  . Had a great experience as a first timer.  Dr. Ramesh  Kering  is very competent , approachable, patient and caring . He took his time to explain my condition with me as well as my treatment options. His  demeanor put me at ease.  I highly recommend this clinic .
BUT …
BEWARE OF THE FRONT DESK STAFF . THE LADIES ARE OMNIPOTENT AND OMNIPRESENT… I ALMOST CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT CONSULTATING THE GOOD DOCTOR SEEING THEIR RUDE BEHAVIOUR. "
1 star,Treatment was fair and good however behaviour of front desk staff was miserable. My mom had done with plaster with them and was charged 8500 Rs. We did requested and negotiated it to be finalized at 8000 Rs. However they completely refused to give receipt for same. Otherwise was asking to pay full bill of 8500 Rs. They just refused patient's right to ask for legal bill receipt.
