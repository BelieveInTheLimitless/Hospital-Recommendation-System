5 stars,"One stop solution for all orthopedic problems.

It's a huge facility with all the lastest facilities. Every department is spacious with ample seating area and can accommodate lots of patients.

From the main gate, there is excellence maintained, if you come by car, you'll get a token to park, and they have basement parking with reasonable parking fee.

They have lifts to all the floors and the facilities is spacious and clean.

As you enter the patient and the one accompanying should register and then you will be directed to the concerned department.

Even if you walk in, you'll be treated well.

I would recommend you to visit the hospital early before 12, as it tends to get crowded post 11:30am. Though the crowd seems to be attended fast, it's better to come early or book appointment ahead of time to save your time.

The consultation fee is 400+.

You get good consultation and also all the options for recovery will be given to you so that you can make a choice based on what fits you best.

It's a great hospital if you have to treat any bone related issue as this hospital specializes in this area.

Over all it's a good hospital better than going to a general hospital and trying to find a orthopedic.

Also this is located close to the railway station of Pune, about 3km from station, so easy to access, also it's on the main road, you can come here by road easily. "
5 stars,"Located in the heart of Pune city this hospital is the best in class orthopaedic hospital in Pune.
Management staff, doctors & care takers all are co-operative & supportive.

Hospital is well maintained & all specialists are available here in hospital.all amnesties are there including lift, common bathrooms, canteen drugstore and visitors seating area. Valet parking available with nominal fees.

Special attention & care has been taken for patients. "
1 star,"One of the worst service provider, doctor wrote wrong injury report and submitted to Claim to XYZ company and that company denied my claim and informed concerned senior Dr. Parag Sancheti and health care manager Rekha But they asked me pay whole amount stating u can claim later. I have their justification letter and wrong injury report sent to claim office. Doctors are very casual approach towards patient. I was solo patient with ACL (Ligament tear) tear went to hospital 3 days continuously but no use.

Very casual approach by doctors at Sancheti Hospital, Pune

All can go through following images.

Handwritten is correct one and other one is wrong report.

Staffs are not supportive at all.

Dear patients kindly be careful. "
5 stars,"The overall experience with this hospital was very pleasing. The staff is very supportive and guiding. I really appreciate there good understanding. Cleaning staff made my experience good.
And finally most important that I experienced Impressive perfect diagnosis by doctors. "
5 stars,"Excellent experience of getting operated for ACL reconstruction at Sancheti hospital, Pune.
Highly skilled doctors available to take care of your health needs.
Cooperative and empathetic staff, who are always available to address all queries.
Wonderful postoperative rehabilitation services provided by Physiotherapists.
Will definitely recommend for all orthopaedic issues. "
1 star,"Worst management ever. Delays even though having scheduled an appointment and waited for 2 hours post scheduled slot.  Still haven’t got the slot to get the follow up. Being from a different state and not able to converse in native tongue puts you in disadvantage. They will hold it against you. Favours the one with who speaks native and who are actually paying for other services along side the check ups.
Not a single ounce of professionalism. Favouring the rich n natives end of story.
If you are normal middle class person better not come here to waste 3 hours just to get check up. No use of booking the appointment either.
Worst part is they no respect of your time either. "
5 stars,"Hospital is well cleaned
Staff is good
Doctor are good,
For ortho there is one solution in Pune "
4 stars,Very nice hospital.. Cleanlisness is maintained.. Excellent treatment.  Parking is a limited.. 
5 stars,"I had severe pain in right arm and cervical spine. Everywhere suggest surgery. But Dr Ajay kothari completely cure my cervical spine issue medication and exercise...
Thank you so much Dr Ajay kothari sir.... He is the best spine specialist "
1 star,"Worst experience at OPD of Dr. Shailesh Hadgaonkar. You will not get proper consultation. I visited here with my mother for her back pain. In first visit - with 2 minutes interaction with patient, Doctor asked asked to have two MRI's.
We thought in next visit Dr. Shailesh will give proper time but in 2nd visit within no time after overviewing the MRI's doctor suggested to take admission in hospital for taking some injections.

They will ask for your profession and health insurance for better understanding of your health.

Worst OPD queue management. We booked appointment at 4 pm and we had to wait till 6.30 pm.

Too much expensive. Two MRI'S costing is 16000/- (outside sancheti you can get it for 9000 also) + consultation fee 750/- + injection & admission charges 70000/-(general ward). "
5 stars,"My mother having severe low back pain in both lower limbs and lumbar spine.she is 77 years old.I was not sure she will work again then I met Dr Ajay kothari.He completely cure my mother spine issue medication treatment and she is better now.
Thank you Dr Ajay he is best spine specialist "
1 star,"I don't want to give any star but without giving it I can't write my review ,met Dr parag sancheti for my mother's knee revision surgery he didn't listen to us not even saw her reports and was suggesting very illogical treatment which non of any orthopaedic suggested us and just forcing to talk about treatment cost with there representative thn will decide treatment. I don't know patient ki condition dekh kr treatment decide Krna hota hai ya cost k hisab se . Very very bad experience, will never suggest anyone to go there . "
1 star,They are now looting people just to complete the other buildings besides the main one. Senior sancheti was good but he is now too old to handle. They were planning to charge me double the money but I managed to go somewhere else. 
2 stars,"This is one of the best hospitals in Pune when it comes to orthopedic problems but doctors here need to learn time management. They have to be punctual to the time they commit to the hospital. Also, the OPD team should be capable of managing appointments in case doctors are late.

I have been to this hospital multiple times in the last one year and have consulted with many doctors here but the punctuality problem is faced with all of them. Doctors need to understand just like their jobs we people also have jobs and we take a leave or manage our time to consult with you "
1 star,"First let me clear you all that , this review is not about hospital services which are very good in all manner. This is about security services at the entrance gate, in visiting hours also there are too many hurdles to visit patient. Also they don't even look after pass returned and cause trouble to next visitor by claiming previous pass yet not received 😡 . Very poor service. Management need to look into this matter. "

5 stars,"Best in class orthopaedic hospital in Pune...
I met an accident and got right knee injury, so I took primary treatment in Sancheti Hospital immediately after accident, Dr. Chetan Pradhan gave me necessary treatment and also suggested for a knee hinged brace and told to take MRI Test...
After a week I took MRI Test and found that ACL and MCL had grade 3 tear 😥...

Therefore surgery was planned on 29th of November 2021, before that I had to under go some fitness test, fitness test were clear...

So surgery was done on 29th Nov, surgery was successful and Dr. Parag Sancheti himself did the operation.

I had to stay admit for 3 days, in which there were regular Dr check up. Dr. Parag Sancheti himself used to visit and use to clear all my doubts[ He is such a polite and humble person ].

Apart from that all the staff was very supportive and helpful, they took very good care. Room has all the facilities like TV, AC, Fridge , Cupboard, Canteen was also very hygienic. Mama and Mavshi also used to clean the room twice / thrice a day...

Overall I felt very positive atmosphere in hospital... 👍 "
5 stars,Dr Shailesh Hadgaonkar is the most experienced and best spine surgeon sancheti hoapital pune. My mother is walking well because of sir. She was crippled with leg ain. Now 90% better ..Thank yoy sir. Our all relatives are your patient as well 
1 star,Such a pathetic hospital for all type of patients but specifically for senior citizens. Worst OPD queue management for appointments. We booked appointment at 5.30pm and we had to wait till 7pm. Been here for my mother 3 time post surgery and every time this happens. Co patients said the same thing they also experienced. Everyone some or the other patients relative have fights for this matter. Soon people turn to some other hospitals. 
5 stars,"I had great experience with Sancheti Hospital,Pune. I had gone through k-wire surgery under Dr.warid Altaf.
He is one of the best orthopedic Doctor and I had good experience with him for operation,consultation. "
4 stars,"Annual Health Checkup ..
The hospital has created a very beautiful space within the hospital,neet and clean.

Once you enter here,it gives you a feeling of a VIP lounge,a comfort feeling,takes away your attention that you have entered a hospital

Everything else is just as any other hospitals..

But this lounge is what I found different from other places .. "

Also, Thanks to Dr. Sunny Gugale for operating. He is skilful and very efficient surgeon . "
2 stars,"Worst OPD and OT management..Post surgery made us wait for 8 hours to get us a room. Care manager ..Staff all useless nobody helped instead threw shade at us.
Patient was not taken care of and hospitality even of HRs is worse than the attitude. "

1 star,"Pathetic money making, business mindset-oriented hospital. They mistreated my daughter without taking proper care or following proper process to treat her right-hand fracture. They are only interested to treat you properly if you agree for surgery, as we opted for conventional method of plaster, Doctor directly applied the plaster without doing the proper bone alignment or doing this under anesthesia.
They were hell bent on doing the surgery. Further there was no post plaster X-Ray done to check if plaster done is correct or not, which clearly shows the utter negligence on part of Sancheti hospital and their only interest is to provide proper treatment if
we agree for the Surgery.
We have experienced this with team of Doctors (Dr. Sandeep Patwardhan, Dr. Atul Patil & Dr. Chaitali).

Their pathetic mismanagement does not end here the list continues... they further added wrong injury details on the report, and when asked for correction, it was done by writing on already printed report.

Worst experience, please avoid at all cost if you want to save yourself from the Trauma at their trauma center and if you want to save your hard-earned money and time. "
5 stars,Very good surgeon. I am 9 months after spine fusion surgery. Completely fine.Dr shailesh Hadgaonkar chief spine surgeon sanvheti hospital is best doctor 
5 stars,"2 months ago my right arm and hand got paralyzed because of nerve compression In cervical spine..was not sure it will work again

He also suggested a good pillow "
1 star,Pathetic doctors on weekends. They sent me to spine brain specialist for leg pain. There were two spine specialist one was intern I guess. Both of them had no idea about basic leg muscles pain treatment. The so called sr spine specialist …  More
2 stars,Too much expensive. I had knee injury but doctor told me to have xray and MRI report. MRI costing is 8000/- which is not affordable and  they already takes the consultation fees of 750/- xray 500 and did not provide any medication unless and until you gave them MRI report so it was a little bad experience because I had wasted my 1150/- but did not get any treatment . Even though it takes too much time till you get your turn management is too slow 
1 star,Visit this hospital only if you wish to waste your valuable time.... They give appointment of 2 pm and you will be taken for consultation of doctor after 5.30 pm.... They don't understand the value of other's time.... What is the use of giving appointment to people.... Useless Hospital 
5 stars,"I had great experience with Dr Ajay kothari sir as he treted me when i was suffering with severe left side spine pain at 2 years ago that time i couldnot walk at all and had no control on mobility...finaly we went to dr ajay kothari sir clinic and he treated my severe spine pain  and done mijimal invasive TLIF operation and finally im back to my normallifestyle

5 stars,"Very honest and noble doctor Dr Ajay kothari
He cured my cervical and lumbar spine slip disc "
1 star,"Very fraudulent service.  I will give zero rating for this hospital, giving any presidential award to the owner of this hospital is worthless.  Lootere Hospital is a hospital that steals money.  Muah May Ram and Bagal May.  Knives are traded here.  The owner of this hospital is the father of the organization that takes the money.  There is little to say.  In the end it will say fraudulent hospital system.Worst administration and billing staff
Unnecessary they hold patient for discharge day for including billing for that day.Not recommendated as very time consuming and costly also.A hospital that extorts money by talking. "
4 stars,"Decent hospital for medical services, there are two patients in each room. They provide only breakfast here, Lunch and dinner is from patient's pocket. "

1 star,"Dr Waygaonkar is the worst consultant we came across all hospitals in Pune related to ortho speciality. My brother Mr Abhishek Taur was not consulted well due to which he suffered a permanent deformity of his right hand little finger.
Because he provided a wrong splinting method for his mallet finger. Also while my brother tried to ask for specific ways to use the splint he made fun of his question and was disrespectful "
3 stars,"Sharing Pros and Cons based on my recent experience for my mom’s hip surgery.

Pros:
- Best Orthopaedics in Pune specially if you are looking for senior citizen or accident cases
- All testing facilities inside hospital so you dont have to run around for tests
- Charges are slightly lower compared to other big hospitals in Pune
- Admission and Emergency room staff was well trained and courteous

Cons:
- Rooms and toilets will remind you of government hospitals (even private/deluxe ones)
- General Security and admin is also like government hospitals. Visitor pass is only for name and relatives are always crowding the rooms and corridors. Staff and security is least bothered about it.
- Its a teaching hospital so be ready for interns junior doctors flocking over your patient all the time. My mom had a terrible experience with all the interns (read spectators) discussing her surgery loudly in OT as she was not given full anaesthesia and could hear loud conversations throughout her surgery.
- Attendant (mama/maushi) team is always understaffed hence causing inconvenience to patients
- Physiotherapist are usually juniors and new doctors hence don’t count on them.
- All medicines and equipments are sold at high prices so better buy/rent from outside if you can
- Patient meals come from canteen and are nowhere close to healthy/nutritious
- Poorly designed building for wheelchairs, stretchers movement causing pain and inconvenience to patient. Its close to impossible to take a wheelchair or stretcher bound patient for some tests (bone density in my case)
- Its been 15+ days since discharge and I am still waiting for my refund of security deposit "
