1 star,"Our patient got discharge 2 days before i expirienced followings:-
Money Oriented hospital, no availability of specialists on time, very casual attitude of dirrctors for cashless and general mangment, nursing staff , biomedicle waste is not at all managed, very loose managment from owners , if they are making bill of 1000rs ask them for discount they will come down to 600 to 500 that shows how much margin they are keeping after each bill. I wish I could give zero star.. "

1 star,"Very bad experience (2 of my relatives were admitted here), if you really care about your patients please don't go to this aadhaar hospital because
1. The name of this hospital is multispecialty, not even a simple blood test lab, they do all the tests from outside, I and my friends have seen some critical patients being sent out for 2D echo, cardiac sonography without any caution.
2. Doctor. 24 hours, this is a total lie, there are no specialist or ""experienced"" doctors permanently in the hospital, specialist/experienced
The doctor visits only ""once"" a day.
3. Some nurses and aunties work well in the hospital, but some are very careless. Management is very bad.
4. The area from where oxygen is sent to the hospital's emergency department is not secured, the department is completely open and dangerously close to semi-private and private rooms.
5. Biomedical waste is kept in close proximity to semi-private and private rooms, thus posing a risk of infection to the patient and accompanying/visiting persons.
6. The hospital is new (people come after seeing the big building from outside) but inside the facilities, service quality charges are not transparent. The hospital charges very high ""charges"" for its services and compared to other reputed hospitals.
7. O.P. You can go here after checking specialist doctor's appointment in DI, but if the patient's condition is serious, please find another option, because the time consuming management here uses ""patient admission policy"" until the specialist doctor arrives, and this can sometimes cost the patient's life and In the name of ""urgency"" they even cut your pocket by charging exorbitant amount of money. "
