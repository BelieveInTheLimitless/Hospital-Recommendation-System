5 stars,"My daughter was sick with high grade fever and was admitted to Yog hospital. My neighbour and friends suggested to consult Dr Anupama Tapadia and Dr Abhijeet Darak. I had best experience from these doctors. They have all the medical facilities to treat critical patients. Very friendly and helpful atmosphere in the hospital,  staffs are very polite and professional. "
5 stars,"I am writing this review for Dr. Rajratna Darak (Gynecologist).
Ma'am, you are an excellent, energetic and one of the most empathetic doctor we have ever consulted with. Your understanding & caring nature, terrific subject knowledge and friendly behavior with the patient separates you from the rest. We would like to express our strong gratitude for your utmost care, love and support during the entire duration of pregnancy to delivery.

I am equally thankful to Dr. Anupana Tapadia (paediatrician and neonatologist) for her support during and after delivery.
Our overall experience with Yog hospital was good.

Thank you guys! "

1 star,"went there for a full body checkup on time.
First I had waited for More than half an hour.
Then the lab person came and collected my blood samples. I was asked to have breakfast. Centeen was just for name. For sonography and other tests takes much time, I had to request a Receptionist, Too much lazy receptionist. Worst experience ever. Do not prefer this hospital for even emergencies. "

5 stars,My experience has been very good. I have been hospitalized during Covid19. Dr. Abhijit Darak took special care and made all the necessary arrangements.

1 star,"I would have given it a negative rating if one was available. I had booked an appointment with Dr. Abhijit Darak based on a recommendation from one of the very good doctors that we know. The hospital staff is absolutely unhelpful. Due to the ongoing Covid situation, they themselves requested that inspite of taking the appointment, please call and come which I thought is good. But then when I kept calling the staff to confirm when can I bring in the patient, they were just so rude and inspite of my multiple follow ups they just said ""Go to a Different Doctor"" and I think that is good, we should never visit this hospital which has such a pathetic staff employed!!! "
4 stars,Dr. Abhijeet Darak has taken very good care and guided us on the medication very practically from time to time. We are in safe hands is what i can say. Staff were polite & professional. Thanks to Dr. Abhijeet and team. 
1 star,"Pathetic service, staff and dr too....Dr visits admitted patients as per his other priorities and convenience and not on basis of patient's health conditions. Staff is rude and uneducated. Too many unrelated lab tests they do just because you have medical insurance. They don't hear patients history and also does not diagnose depending on it. I had admitted my father for covid treatment, but they treated for maleria and then at the end of discharge when bill was paid, like after 5 days of admission they said patient can have covid which I was telling them from first day referring to previous lab reports. They do not consider other lab reports , it's like only their own labs are best. Too expensive even though I was not worried about expenses at that time,but they are playing with patients life and that is too bad. "

1 star,"This looter hospital , I went there for chest CT scan , they charged me 6000 said we need to bring docter by ambulance , actual cost chest CT scan is 2500 to 3500 , these people loot you because you don't have much pre knowledge of charges , these people should feel sham for such things working in field where social service is also 1 aspect of bussines. Prefer another hospital. Seems reception people work on comission basis. If your doctor misplaced his/her gold chain while coming to check anyone , are you charging to that person , thank god your doctor not went to US or newzealand , if so please reply with chest CT scan charges.
