1 star,"Pathetic service . They don't care about the patient . They are only concerned about making money . Doctors have their fixed time of coming at the hospital . It's a Clinic and please don't come for any emergency as they do not have any doctor to atleast adress the emergency patient .
Please don't come here . It's a complete financial and mental peace loss . "
