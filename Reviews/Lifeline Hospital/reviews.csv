1 star,"Worst experience. My 4yrs old son got injured while playing. His left cheek got torn up. It was around 9-9.30 pm we had no options near by and we were in panic, so we went to this hospital. The doctor arrived after the nurse called him. He never looked professional. He asked me to get the medicines from the store as he said we need to put stitches, then while writing the description he was unable to remember the medicines and then answered I have the medicines. He did not use self desolving stitches. He told us we will remove stitches after 4 days. On the 4th day he said we will remove stiches after next 4 days and again did the dressing to earn some money. Then while removing the stiches he slapped the small 4 yrs kid on the right cheek as he was not cooperating. The child was scared as it is obvious he will shout and scream, he is just a 4yrs old kid. The doctor hit him so hard that his finger were traced on the kids cheek. We asked our child about the marks on his cheek but he was not answering due to fear. The. Next day he told his mother that the doctor had hit him. And then when we asked the nurse on a call she said that we did not do this you ask the doctor he did this. And then when we met the doctor he said he was not listening hence I slapped him. I request everyone to avoid going to this hospital for any reason. As the doctor Abhay sonavne is so unprofessional, he does not have simple common sense, patience level to deal with patients. He is a compounder and not a doctor or even worst than that. These peoples have taken degrees by paying, these are not professionals at all. Please avoid going to such hospitals. "
1 star,I had gone here because I needed to shift my home and the new society need the medical certificate which says I am not infected with Covid. The girl at reception gives you the certificate without doctor's sign at 150 rs and if you need it with doctors sign you will hv to pay 200 . This doctor Mr. Sonawane handles two hospitals at a time and so he said he can not come every time to sign. This is really horrible and that girl only checked my Oxygen level and did not chk my temperature.This scam is going on at lot of places.Some Doctors have made covid a business. This is really aweful. Dont ho to such hospitals and question doctors without any fear. I did the same called doctor and asked him to sign on document.
