1 star,"Worst service provided.. Have been runing around for atleast a month for skin specialist appoinment.. Pathetic co-ordination within the staff.. On call they took appointment and after reaching hospital within 15 mins, it is informed that doctor has left.. Are you guys running a hospital or a psych ward.. Morons! "
1 star,"I was injured and instead of guiding me or explaining me the issue, the doctor was asking me do you have a insurance and you have to get admitted. Then i left that hospital and went to another one and they told me to take rest in home. Don't go to sai sneh, they are fooling people. "

1 star,"A WORST HOSPITAL IN PUNE
Very bad service, no proper coordinator
No proper guidance
facility are not available most of time they ask us to shift the patients because of no machine for operations.

At billing time the unnecessarily increase the bill.
Only they focus on money and not on patient. "

1 star,"We admitted under Dr sumeet. And after 3 days of wasting time they called dr paras doshi he found that patient only has typhoid. it took 5 days to find out that my brother has typhoid.If you deciding to admit Someone here don't do it cuz they going to burn your wallet unnecessarily. Whatever your symptoms are they will say you possibly have covid19 and going to take 3 days for taking covid test after they will call other doctors then your proper treatment will start. Even if you have just fever they asks for sonography!
In other hand miss jayshri and doctor don't have good co-ordination they confuses patient for taking money. My last advice for people who wants to admit their relatives don't do any test without taking information and receipts from anand siddhi lab. Lab personnel going to take 1500‚Çπ for 400‚Çπ test and will say we did it mistakenly. "

5 stars,Sir your hospital service is good. But there is displeasure among citizens outside. Because when my son was admitted. Then some of my friends and colleagues told me why they admitted there. You have to think about this a bit. Because it is thought provoking sir. Where is the hospital's weak point? So as I know you need to get all medicine panel varthi add from medical. See if it can be done. Ok rest all the best.
