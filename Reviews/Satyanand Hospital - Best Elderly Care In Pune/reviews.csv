1 star,Staff was very rude and doesn't allow an old lady to use the washroom just because she has not availed any facilities such as OPD or anything. She was refused to use the washroom. Is this the way u treat an old lady. U Don't know if she has urine incontinence and may be seeking a washroom as it is crowded market areas and sees a hospital in which she can use a washroom. This is not a way to treat a lady. They had not allowed that lady to use the washroom even after multiple requests. Very disappoint with such gesture.

Consulted Dr Amita Raina, she is the owner of hospital, but the way she treats patients is amazing. Very down to earth.
She will firstly listen to all your health issues/ symptoms whatever and then will prescribe the medicines.
Also she doesnt prescribe costly/ over priced medicines. In this era when many hospitals are just after running their business and try to loot people with unnesessary medicines / tests.
At satyanad, only the tests which are actually required are recommended and also at a very affordable cost. "

They will not only trouble you but would also risk the life of your near ones by their negligence and money business. I recently opted for their services for my Mother who had undergone heart surgery. I needed a care tacker support and hence encountered this institute. Believed in them (compared to other individual provider) as they seemed to be medical facility and was over promised by the sales attendant (they charge fairly higher than other provider). Well, from the very first day, after opting for their services, I tried reaching them for my concern but they were least interested for the same and went no show by not attending my calls and msz. You wont believe, they suddenly shown their presence while asking for money.
They send some random person for providing care tacker service to a post operative patient. You will be surprised to know that she traveled a day before meeting my Mother (I insisted this institute to provide me negative COVID report) and they were least interested for it. Further, when I raised my complain regarding the care tacker (as she was not able to read and provide medication to the patient) and asked for replacement immediately, they did not focus on this and stopped attending my calls. When I raised written complain, they put all the blame on me and asked why did I not opt services from others. Would suggest to go through the attached mail communication that I received from HR Manager of this institute (last communication went unanswered). Would also like to highlight the name of the sales/nurse attendant or whatsoever you wanna call her. Her name is Fatima (worst medical professional I would have ever encountered till date, though I belong to a Medical family, still have not seen a pathetic lady than this). and now a pathetic facility than this "

They do not have   required machines  to do the check up and and they keep you waiting saying that  the process is going on of check up but they do nothing, keep you for  a couple of days and make money  and then they tell you   and give  you reasons. And  the staf they are  stupid they tell the patient go do things them self.
When the patien is not even in the state to move from his place.
Do not hav a professional  environment.

5 stars,"My mother who was 83 years was bed ridden so we were looking  for a care giver. We appointed a few but not really satisfied so i approached sister Marilyn from Satyanand  hospital who connected me to Fatima. Fatima visited my home with laxmi the care giver. Both sanitized before entering, saw my mother. Fatima, a calm n gentle lady,soft spoken explained to laxmi how to take care of my mother. And laxmi did a good job by taking my mother's BP, temperature n oxygen level time to time. She was also kind n gentle n updated everything about my mother to Fatima..Fatima even called in a doctor in emergency for my mother, arranged the oxygen machine for us at home. she was very helpful right from day 1 n reminded to me of things to be done when a person dies. She even helped me to get the form of death from the nearest hospital. She comforted us in our sadness.People like Fatima r rare n I have never encountered such gems in my life so far. It was a pleasure knowing people like Fatima n laxmi from Satyanand hospital. keep up the good work. "

Thank you for doing such a wonderful job of taking care of our Mother for us.

Your patience with her is truly admirable.

Your persistence with Mom and today we have achieved what will set Mom on her path for recovery to be able to finally go home.

And it is such a pleasure to observe Nazma carrying on a normal conversation with Mom as and when it would be prompted.

Rekha and her charts  - keep us all sorted.

The Manicure and Pedicure - Rekha gave Mom - and Mom was just all smiles.

Just the first sight of Mom looking all peaches and cream and smelling so fresh warms our hearts. Thank you to you both.

It is because of you both that we are stress free. You both have given us a comfort zone.

Together we are learning and helping Mom.

God Bless you Both.

Thank you.
