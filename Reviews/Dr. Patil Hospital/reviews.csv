1 star,"This hospital is a door to death, they won't give the patients food to eat and will treat patients like beggar and not provide proper facilities. Will not recommend this hospital. "
1 star,This is one of the worst hospital in sinhagad road and as well as in Pune. My father is the patient of diabetes. The doctor Patil suggested various tests. Which were totally useless. They also prescribed several medicines which were not even available in there medical. My father was called for the test at 3:30 p.m. but the man who was supposed to come for conducting the test arrived at almost at 6:00 P.M. they  will let you setting for long hours. They will collect all the fees in advance. And will provide worst services. 
5 stars,Doctor consultations is very good. I'm happy with that.

1 star,"Dr is very rude, he prescribe medicines which you will not able to buy from any other pharmacies.

Pharmacist will not give single penny of discount on even surgical items. Only money making business nothing else.

Dr prescribed many tests for minor disease, which got cured by few antibiotics. Due to lockdown, we preferred this hospital which was near to our house, but our decision was wrong.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our family doctor suggested to ask for discharge earliest & he prescribed few antibiotics only. "
1 star,Service is not good. Staff response is so slow. ...... Careless staff

1 star,"I had took my father as he had stomach bloating!  My regret for life time.

Worst hospital in the world, money minded treatment, cure is secondary, deposits are primary requirement. Waiting time can be till death at times. Staff(Reception lady )is rude too

The Doctor earned few thousands but I lost my FATHER.

Dr. Patil will ask to generate all the reports for the equipments they have in hospital.

Cause: Stomach bloated.

Day 1) I spent 30k doing all test! Which also included stomach sonography from another lab! My dad was made to drink 32 ounces of water for the sonography.

Day 2) Post all the test he identified the illness as a hole in the heart, Which as per him was formed at birth! So next day my father went to him again to check, he gave some medicines for the heart which was for 7000/-.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Day 3) he feels uneasy due to bloated stomach for which we visited him on day 1. I asked him to visit dr.patil as he knows what all happed in last two days. My father drives and reaches the hospital and informs the doctor now he has pain too! Two days ago the stomach was also small now it’s bloated more and he can’t bare the pain.soon the admitted him and gave him medication and Multiple injections. In an hours time my father who had drives and reached the hospital is totally unconscious and I could see no experienced doctors around also dr Patil was not available there!! I decided to move him to Poona hospital. I showed the doctors all reports that we did in 2 days before.one of the doctor was shocked to hear that we did sonography which made him drink a bottle of water. He said why did u do this test! He already had a bloated stomach he should not have drank any water.. there was already water accumulation which made his stomach bloat now the excess water from sonography in stomach added to the complications, before doctor could much the pressure of water in the stomach brought down his renal system and kidneys to keep up doctor started dialysis but before the entire procedure was complete he left us......!

1 star,"Worst hospital, Dr. Patil will ask to generate all the reports for the equipments they have in hospital. And assistant staaf is saying that Dr. Will not accept any report genarated in math ( e.g. Ramkrishna math on same rd.). Fees  rs 600 rs after waiting of 2 hrs for dr. Not recommended for cold also.  My friends also having bad experience. Total cost of test was 16000/- i did full body checks up in Lucid in 3100/- only in offers. "
