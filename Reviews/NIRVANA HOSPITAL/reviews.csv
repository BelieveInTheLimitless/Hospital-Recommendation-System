1 star,"The hospital is very small and during these times, patients are still sitting right next to each other. Other patients are coughing out in the open and nobody from the staff seems to bothered. Not hygienic. They gave me wrong information saying they provide a bmc letter and made me go there twice. Poor conditions with all patients sitting next to each and coughing openly into the air which is located on the main road. Very disappointed. "
