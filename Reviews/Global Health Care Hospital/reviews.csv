5 stars,"Had admitted my dad suffering due to enzyme, lower BP and fever.
Dr Saud took a great care along with Dr Imran with his best expertise. Hospital and hospitality are on top notch.
Finally met with the doctor who listens to the patient and patients family with patience and also gives a transparency with the treatment and on going medication.
Though the hospital is of 7 beds but the treatment is worth appreciable. "
