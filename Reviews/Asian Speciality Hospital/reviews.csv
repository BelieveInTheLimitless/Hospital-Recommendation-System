5 stars,"Visited today Asian Speciality Hospital,. Bhugaon, to attend a wound on the ankle.
All staff right from the reception, to Dr Mahajan who was on  duty and  the nurses who attended my wound did it very efficiently , cleaned , two injections and was out of the hospital in less than 15 minutes.

This is the second time in 30  months , the first time in January ,2020 , was for a severe cough just when the COVID 19 virus had arrived.
On that occassion Dr Tayde made a thorough check up , BP, blood test, chest congestion checks, etc and recommended just one ayurvedic cough syrup and advised some other home remedies.
Without any antibiotics ( which I avoid and dislike) ,I was fully OK in around 12-14 days.

1 star,"I went to Asian hospital in emergency as I was looking for a dermatologist urgently as my face was burning up so badly that I have to keep my hands to cover my cheeks to reduce the pain and when I reached there, I asked the lady on the counter to get me a dermatologist urgently and she said you have to call and book then we can hook an appointment, I told them itâ€™s really urgent and told them about the face burning sensation but she still said no sir we do only call basis, I was standing there in shock I asked her is it a hospital or not, where you should help the patient if his/her condition is bad, I mean Iâ€™m obviously going to pay you guys not asking for a free treatment. Thatâ€™s why really poor management. I donâ€™t even want to give one star but canâ€™t do anything. "
