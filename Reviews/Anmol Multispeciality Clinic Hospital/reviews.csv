5 stars,They have an homeopathic clinic too. Safe for children care. Reasonable fees. Steamer is also available at nominal fee for cold symptoms. Special reward points for patients. Caring and supporting staff. One thing I found interesting is they call you for follow-up (To see if the patient is feeling better. Even if miss to show up on follow up date). 
2 stars,"Extremely dusty as it is located beside the main road carrying hundreds of trucks and buses every hour.
Most of the doctors are MDs but not experienced. Service is very good interms of registration, follow ups, availability of doctors etc. It may have bright future but should maintain cleanliness and focus on few things instead of all under same roof approach. "
