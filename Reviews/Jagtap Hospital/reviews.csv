4 stars,"I recently had to visit the hospital for a minor procedure, and overall, my experience was fantastic. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and the facilities were clean and well-maintained. I felt well taken care of and confident in the care I was receiving.

However, the one downside to my experience was the parking situation. Finding a spot was difficult, and the lot was quite far from the entrance. This added an extra level of stress to an already nerve-wracking situation.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Despite this, I would still highly recommend this hospital for its exceptional staff and top-notch care. Just be prepared to do a bit of walking or consider other transportation options. "
2 stars,Reception manages appointments based on no criteria. I was waiting for doctor for 1hr 15mins. Doctor comes in and  they just let go someone came after 1 hr with no explaination.

1 star,"I have a very bad Experience about OPD.
I was waiting with my 8 year old kid from 9.15 pm.
I was only patient that time and doctor was on round. During his return hospital persons added before me, case papers of their known persons who came after me. No one from them was emergency case. And my daughter was having 100+ fever.
Shame on thease people, who don't have hearts.

Overall the best hospital for all type of treatment. "
5 stars,Jagtap hospital has been providing excellent and essential healthcare for over 35 years now. The new and renovated hospital is extremely well run with both the doctors and staff being very courteous and accomodating. They have clean and hygenic rooms for all types of patients and state of the art operation theatres for various specialties. I have personally known dr. Prajakta jagtap for over 15 years now and you won't find a more capable compassionate and ethical doctor to treat you. The jagtap family have catered to the community by providing excellent healthcare for over 40 years now. The hospital lists in oas one of the best in the city with the top radiologist in the city working there. It's a family run hospital of the highest standard. 
5 stars,"Dr. Rajeev jagtap has been our family physician for over 35 years.He is an expert in everything.Best family doctor ever. We are treated like family. You are not just a number.

1 star,"Worst ever customer Experience,Have wasted my 2 hrs there for vaccination on morning ,they told me once 10 people will available then only we will provide the Dose and told us to share your number so that we can give you a call ,however no call happens , finally I had called to them and they told please come .again 1 hr spent while my turn came ,they told sir we need again 10 person for vaccination .being in to hospitality is it the the way to treat the customer?

If vaccine is not available then you people could have told us upfront so that I could manage to go some other Hospital.

5 stars,Nice service taking care. Better staff and best work 
5 stars,"I was treated by Dr. Punarvasu (ortho), with explanation and personal attention. The hospital takes extra precautions during covid times. It is hygienic and clean. All the staff are very courteous.

Dr. R.Jagtap, a very senior and experienced doctor has exceptionally good diagnosis and remedy as per my experience as an OPD patient earlier. "
5 stars,Dr. Punarvasu after physical examination and X-rays accurately diagnosed and treated my wrist pain. He explained how he narrowed down the probable diagnosis which was helpful. Will visit again for sport related injuries. 
5 stars,"The Hospital doctors and the staff members are very friendly. My family member was treated very well and the kind of treatment meted to him amidst the Covid Pandemic was a big relief. Dr. Ravi jagtap was in touch with updates and kept me and my family reassured of everything diligently especially since no family could be there in the hospital due to Covid. Dr. Rajeev Jagtap and his team took good care of my family members and were always available for my family member if and when needed. Overall, I would like to thank the doctors and the hospital for their care and treatment to my family member amidst the Covid Pandemic and for helping my family member recover with the treatment and become fully fit. "
1 star,The most dubious hospital ever witnessed in life. I had gone for a normal checkup and the Dr was forcing me to get admitted. They did my ECG at first when getting reports they gave me unconfirmed report which mentioned some problems but when I asked them to give me confirmed reports it was all normal. Similarly they had forced the patient before me to do all the tests and those too were all normal. There was no rush or anything but had to wait for 1 and half hour for my checkup. Try avoiding this hospital as much as possible. The rating doesn't even deserve one star but to post my review i had to rate it.

1 star,"Have visited 1st time to Japtap hospital to gain details regarding vaccination process for my mom, enquiry counter lady have kept me waiting for almost 10-15 mins. She have ignored me many times, as she was busy collection money and other bills..there were 2 ladies and both were busy doing calculation of a single bill..

N later she have told me that vaccination is not available at the moment..

Request you to Please keep your enquiry counter people Pro active and helpfull by nature as this is your hospital front face..

Thanks..

Reply to your mes..

Firstly I am not having any kind of EGO I am just sharing my review. I am an individual and I have rights to give review on Google / any social media platforms.

Coming back to your points I had already called on your number(hospital no) where I was unable to contact you..
And I was not there who was causing crowding as there were few people on the counter, approximately 1/2..

Coming back to your fav part of my review.
Well u have heard it right Sir, yes she was busy collection money.. your doctor 1st I agree ur not a monk.. you can charge for wht you are doing,not an issue bt m talking abt your staff ignored me 2-3 times (there were 2 ladies doing the same stuff)..comeon 1lady can do the work, why there were 2ladies doing the same work.?
And you are telling your having less staff members..

Coming back to your quality, well I have already seen few facebook live reviews but still thought that your service might be good, bt unfortunately the Facebook review was correct I guess..

5 stars,"My baby was born here a month back and really appreciable staff and Doctors.
Doctor Rajeev Jagtap and Madhura are really nice and we had a normal delivery. We changed to this hospital in last minute when my wife was around 8 months pregnant. We consulted many famous hospitals  before but heard of C-sections from all our friends been there.

The staff is really co-ordial and helping. Even at late night the nurse showed up when baby was crying and helped in calming the baby.

Infrastructure wise, it is due for rennovation but that is secondary to me considering the fact that doctors and staff are humble and believe in ethical practice.

1 star,"Doctor Jagtap and Lutmar Company
Admitted at 6:45 AM on 18/11/2019 for abdominal pain and doctor did not diagnose. All tests were done except sonography and doctor Jagtap says don't teach me wisdom. When asked what happened, they started fighting. Admitted to ICU for simple abdominal pain and told to deposit 20000 otherwise the patient will not survive. I told the doctor in ICU that the stomach was very painful and sir was listening to songs with headphones. If Dr. Jagtap complains strongly, the doctor says that you are speaking very arrogantly. Actually, these people are not worthy to be called doctors. Any layer can be used to extract money only.
And the maximum is that the doctor's bribe does not matter when the patient is admitted.
And doctors also say that it is the patient who lies.

In pain how can some one do ECG and say it's an unconfirmed report. And these guys who do ECG are the worst they don't care about patient. The lady said my shift will be over in 5 mins and I don't care about your pain am just here for ECG Please. Guys avoid this hospital and specially doctor Jagtap. "

4 stars,"Hello 🙏

We all know the name Jagtap Hospital in one of the reputed hospitals and emergency service providers on Sinhagad Road. But the information about the various mistakes going on here may not have reached you, so a small review from us

If your family has insurance or you are ready to pay huge bills then Jagtap Hospital is the best place for you but if we talk about the staff in the hospital then we cannot say the same at all. You will see extreme carelessness in the staff here. It takes less than 30 hours for them to know exactly what disease a patient has, and even if they do, the focus of all the hospital staff is on how many more tests we can do on them rather than at least what the cause is. don't understand

Anyway, friends, after seeing everything here, we are now sure that Balram Nagpal from Gabbar can come alive here. 😁

Just as a common citizen wishes that his loved ones never have to go to a clinic or hospital and if they do, at least we expect a place where all the hospital staff will help us with all the facilities or procedures in the hospital without any inconvenience or inconvenience. There will be no cheating. I am very sorry to say but surely we cannot come to Jagtap Hospital with the above expectations from now on.

Here's a short review of where we're taking our families and where we shouldn't be. 🙏 "
