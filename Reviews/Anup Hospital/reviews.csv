1 star,"He is a third class doctor.He is a typical businessman who operates patients for earning money even if they are not required a surgery.And once you go through the operation procedure,he will not even pick up your phone and his whole staff will make excuses.They do not care about the condition of patient once surgery is done .Dr Anil Gandhi is a biggest liar.These kind of doctors must be punished by the law.He has no social and moral responsibilities towards his patients.And REST IN PEACE his operation skills.
