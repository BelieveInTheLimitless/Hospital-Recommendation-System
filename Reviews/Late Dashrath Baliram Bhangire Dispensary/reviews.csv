3 stars,"As usual a government place, you ask know what to expect. I was there for vaccination which was not available. People running the place are over the cloud 9 it seems the place belongs to them. Ending the property. "
5 stars,"Very clean , Quickly responsive Hospital....love the service. "
2 stars,"I was vaccinated for covid on 3rd March after a wait time for about 4 hours. In the meantime people coming after were being obliged.
Anyway, after 6 weeks of schedule interval I again visited on 14th April for my second dose, but I was not administered with the second dose of covishield on the pretext that the above vaccine was not available. Nobody was responsible enough to guide properly as to when the vaccine will be available or when should I visit again. I was not even permitted to enter the office and talk to the authorities.
Such a irresponsible behaviour with a senior citizen. Now where should I go for my second dose.???? "

1 star,"Very bad service is being provided patient was sitting for covid vaccine from 7 am literally at 11 am they are sent back home due to lack of mobile registration, hey if everyone had condition to get android mobile then why would they have come to govt hospital pls senior officials should look into this Otherwise we had to complain "
4 stars,It is a government hospital of Pune Municipal Corporation. It has started during the Corona period. All types of government medical services at low rates are available here. Needy people should take advantage of this. Vaccination of both covishield and covaxin is going on at Sadhya. Ample space is available for parking.
