1 star,"I had weakness, Urine infection on 4 March and got admitted.. there was some female dr who didn't know what need to be done.. nurse came and told get admit and for one day it's 1100 around including nursing charges... And i got admitted... I kept on IV and after that not a single dr came to visit,  in every hour some staff coming to ask for money..money to do test, money to pay advance and so on.. coming to fill form and they didn't even know the spelling of some words and on that they were arguing with me.. washroom so unclean, room full of mosquito... I had some questions regarding the reimbursement so nurse came and told me to come down dr wants to talk to u..they removed my IV and asked me to come down by climbing stairs.. but dr didn't came up. And surprisingly the bill was 12000 for a single day.. dr i asked why bill so high they said the file charges is 100, dr approval for admission cost is 2000  and so on...  My blood was came out due to iv fail but nobody came untill i asked t come... At the time of discharge also they kept me waiting for 2 hours..  and when was admitted neise sat in that room by listening song very loudly...very very pathetic hospital..they just want to pull money... Don't go there... Really cheap eople with cheap mindset "
5 stars,"""The best hospital near my home in Handewadi. My parents go to this hospital for any medical problem. Good Doctors and Team.""  Dr. Kirtane Sir will manage all medical problem and Keep Supporting To patients "
5 stars,Dr Jaiswal sir treated my mom. And boost her confidence. Now she can walk. 
1 star,Do not visit this hospital. Dr. Jaiswal is a Diploma holder who do not understand the patients problem correctly. We spend 9k for elbow fracture at nixi and it's been 6 months the problem is not solved yet.

1 star,"Don't visit this hospital unless you are badly in need. This hospital is charging almost 3 times more for X-ray , we can imagine how much they are looting the patient's in the form of other treatment and to their accompany in-house medical store is there.. medicines which can be purchased outside at 30% less price are being sold at 30% extra price... I don't recommend at all ...

It's my choice to decide whether I wish to take multiple opinions / consultation or not, it's none of anyone's business. I am paying everyone and not looting anyone.

Secondly I know rates of Government hospitals and hospitals like yours who are looting their patients and  taking disadvantage

X-ray which is costing 460 outside (even in private)is charged at your hospital at 1200/-

Deliberately prescribing medicines which are available at in-house chemist shop is another way of looting money from patients.

5 stars,Well behaved and organized staff. Good hospital for treatment. 
1 star,Keep this hosptial as your last option. Mr. Jaiswal is an incompetent doctor who do not understand the problem correctly. We had very very bad experience for my Mother. 
1 star,"This is the worst Hospital,  I have seen. Doctor  and staff worst. My mother was infected with Covid. They have not done any treatment. Infact they give food from Hotel to patients. Such a pathetic treatment. We moved our Mother to other Hospital. Nixi has crested scene while discharge also. Only Money oriented. We have lost our Mother. If treatment would have been given in time, her survival chances were high. Never ever go to this Hospital, if you want to see your dear ones alive. "
1 star,"Giving one star * ,since there is no option of 0 ...,,,Dr. Jaswall is one of the worst doctor. Slave of money. He declared my dad Covid positive by just looking at him. No test nothing. He was only having stomach upset which was later found to be Jaundice, when we took him to another hospital.
Never go to this hospital. "

1 star,"I was literally robbed at the hospital, I had an infection near the left side finger due to biting my nail and due to the infection it created Pus which needed to be extracted, first doctor asked me to do a blood test to verify if I have diabetes, I told them just before 4 months I did this test and it's all normal, still they forced me to do a test which was around 250rs I said okay fine it's not too high amount, then the other doctor who was going to extract the pus he said the cost would be 1500rs I said that's too much just to extract the pus, I said I'll do it at home then they realised that I will not pay too high amount for the very tiny surgery and asked me if you are not going to do it here then please pay Doctor charges which was 400rs 😁 He did nothing just looked at it and repeated the same thing which I told him already that pus needs to be extracted 😅 This hospital robbed me for 650rs and not even did anything to cure my finger, finally I myself went to the medical took the necessary medicines and extracted the pus on my own in just 150rs, the reason I'm sharing this review that now a days curing people is just a business, earlier it was god's work, now doctors and their staff do not have any shame to mug people and they think it's quite normal.

In all this situation there was a female doctor who felt bad about all this and she consoled me and said let it be this is what happens in hospitals, also guided me on how to extract the pus, thanks to her, she was a nice person. "
