5 stars,Me along with my mother and grandmother were having slight fever so we immediately visited Trimal Hospital. RT-PCR for each was done which later indicated that all three of us were Covid positive. Further blood tests were done and Dr Ekta prescribed correct line of treatment and all three of us were absolutely fine in a just a few days. Only as a precautionary measure my mom was kept under observation for 3 days as she had slight cough and also because her CT score was 8/25. The facility at the Hospital was well enough and my mother had a comfortable stay for those 3 days. The doctors kept a constant check and she was completely fine and normal at the end of those 3 days at Trimal Hospital. Dr Ekta also recalled my mother for another check few days after her discharge which came out completely normal and fine. Overall we personally had a smooth experience. Great job by Dr Ekta and team!
