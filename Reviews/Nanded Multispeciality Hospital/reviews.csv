1 star,They dont even keep records on patients whi had visited them 2-3 months prior! Needed some documents for surgery for prior history check up and the excuse they give for not giving is they didny have online system to maintain! Never visit this hospital! Pathetic attitude and services! 
1 star,Dr jadhav the pediatric is the most arrogant docter I have ever met In Pune.He looks elderly and experienced which I think has made him irritating and feels like he hates his profession. Doesn't know the way to talk to children and also to their parents.He must understand that the parents along with their children are having a hard time see their children suffer.He doesn't even know the meaning of being sensitive and talking lovingly to children.Waste of my time and money with this guy.His treatment has given me zero benefit . 
2 stars,"Your Time and Money waste, Bad experience, Doctors are not knowledgeable specialy who's duty is continuously staying in hospital day and night, they are not properly guide you if you any think asking to him, I think they are trainy Dr., unnecessary tablet and treatment giving by them and If you not have any fever they saying you, You have a fever and they giving your time waste, also all Doctors are not properly presenting, we are waiting for next day, if they are not coming In a day first.

Nurse staff is good "
1 star,One of the worst hospitals ever. Never go to this hospital especially if there is an emergency. Duty doctors are highly inexperienced and ortho care is absolutely not worth it. Drink water and stay home instead of going to this hospital.

1 star,"We have encountered one incident of burns, and went in here.
What we realised was the fact that the doctor was not very knowledgeable and she just cut the blisters straight away.
After talking to other doctors in Pune ,we came to know that the cutting of blisters was not required at all.
The doctor here made our condition from bad to worse.

Please take care of yourself and account all the risk of you are willing to visit here. "

1 star,"Pathetic service.
They even didnt have wrist band to create pressure while taking out blood sample for test and used one of the glove from the table.

I asked them for the bill to which they said to pay the fees first which I did and later they gave me the bill post 15 minutes and kept me standing.

Looks like they care for the money rather than wellness of the patient.

Pathetic!!!! "
