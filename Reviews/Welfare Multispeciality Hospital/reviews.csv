##Petiont ki family ne qutione kiye toh (police100) ki dhamki dete he Doctor...
Koi sidhi baat nahi karta Sttaf toh bohot laparvah he..
Vo log petiont ki sidhe se dekhbhal nahi karte..
Koi responsible person nahi he hospital me..
##Doctor toh kabhi time pe nahi hote hospital me..
##Ramadan me namaz petiont ke jaan se jyada pyari he Doctor  ke liye, raat me bhi koi dr. Available nahi hote...
##Jumma ke din koi dr petiont ko dekhne nahi aata..
##Me 1 week hospital me thi...
Vaha special room ke naam pe lootte he petiont ko...
##Ac ki vajhase gale me infection huva he mujhe 102 fever huva tha...
##Medical vala hi reception pe hota he aur wardboy ka bhi kaam karta he...
##Jo hume taqlif huvi vo aap sub ko na ho yahi dua he allah se...
##Mera kaam tha aap sub ko aaina dikhana...
Aage aap ki marjhi...
Bass Dua me yaad rakhiye..
