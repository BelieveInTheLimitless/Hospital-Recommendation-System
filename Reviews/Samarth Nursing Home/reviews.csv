1 star,"Worst experience. All of the other google reviews are fake and plz dont fall into this trap.
Not at all helpful staff. The doc doesnt evn answer calls. The staff takes care of patients calls and Dr is unaware of it. The staff is extremely vulger and rude.

DON'T GO. "
1 star,I don't recommend him...I visited by reading the reviews but I think those are fake. He not even tell you what is the issue and what should we do. He will give tablet and call you again after one week. Each time will charge you 400. I visited three times but I have not recovered. Only give pain relief tablets and some sort of ayurvedic tablets which is not helped me at all. 
5 stars,"Very good staff and service, Dr.amit paliwal is are humble and nice person. He always ready to listen to you, and then explain the things. he has very good practice experience.

5 stars,"Advanced Piles Hospital has earned its goodwill in the vicinity of Katraj owing to the service, and expertise and experience of Dr. Amit Paliwal. Besides, the staffs are well mannered and co-operative. The Doctors & staffs leave no stones unturned to make sure that the patients, their family or bystanders are at top of their comfort level. In my honest opinion, if you're in search of a professional & experienced Doctor to take utmost care of your health, Advanced Piles Hospital should be in your priority list. "
5 stars,"I was suffering from fistula. I wasn't aware about it. When i realize it will be dangerous for me, i asked many people regarding this they said u have to do surgery, else u will be in trouble. But i am having fear about allopathic surgeries, in which 1-2 weeks u have to take bed rest only due to stitches n weakness.
I got reference of this from Ekdant Ayurvedic medical. I visited there. Dr. Amit Palival checked me and suggested me for क्षारसुत्र treatment which is without stitches. After doing क्षारसुतत्र, from next day i was regularly going to office, normal day work without any pain and weakness. Due to क्षारसुत्र, my wound healed fast. And after 1.5 months it is healed completely.
Dr. Amit Palival is having expertise in it, he is doing this treatment in many top leading hospitals in Pune. "
5 stars,Advance piles hospital is good hospital because all facilities and caring is good for all. Best piles hospital. I suggest you to come and see the facilities of hospital and the doctor is also very good and the way he talk is nice and the treatment is better and best. I give 5 star to advance piles hospitals because of the providing all facilities and in best quality in treatment.
