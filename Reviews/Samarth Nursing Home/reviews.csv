1 star,"Worst experience. All of the other google reviews are fake and plz dont fall into this trap.
Not at all helpful staff. The doc doesnt evn answer calls. The staff takes care of patients calls and Dr is unaware of it. The staff is extremely vulger and rude.

DON'T GO. "
1 star,I don't recommend him...I visited by reading the reviews but I think those are fake. He not even tell you what is the issue and what should we do. He will give tablet and call you again after one week. Each time will charge you 400. I visited three times but I have not recovered. Only give pain relief tablets and some sort of ayurvedic tablets which is not helped me at all.

5 stars,"Advanced Piles Hospital has earned its goodwill in the vicinity of Katraj owing to the service, and expertise and experience of Dr. Amit Paliwal. Besides, the staffs are well mannered and co-operative. The Doctors & staffs leave no stones unturned to make sure that the patients, their family or bystanders are at top of their comfort level. In my honest opinion, if you're in search of a professional & experienced Doctor to take utmost care of your health, Advanced Piles Hospital should be in your priority list. "
5 stars,"I was suffering from fistula. I wasn't aware about it. When i realize it will be dangerous for me, i asked many people regarding this they said u have to do surgery, else u will be in trouble. But i am having fear about allopathic surgeries, in which 1-2 weeks u have to take bed rest only due to stitches n weakness.
I got reference of this from Ekdant Ayurvedic medical. I visited there. Dr. Amit Palival checked me and suggested me for ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ treatment which is without stitches. After doing ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•Å‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞, from next day i was regularly going to office, normal day work without any pain and weakness. Due to ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡§æ‡§∞‡§∏‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§∞, my wound healed fast. And after 1.5 months it is healed completely.
Dr. Amit Palival is having expertise in it, he is doing this treatment in many top leading hospitals in Pune. "
