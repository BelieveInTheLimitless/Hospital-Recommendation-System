1 star,"Very worst experience, too much expensive for useless service. Can't even give 1 star also.

Dr. Sanap was not supportive, he has opened his hospital only for earn money, poor sanitation. No water facility in washroom, faulty air conditioning.
They don't allow to bring medicine from outside, and not provide discount on in house medicines.
No In house doctor available at any time. They called doctors from outside for visit purpose only.
They don't have nursing staff.

Not recommended at all!! "

Doctor is heartless non supportive
If you have money, go to this hospital

Because they need money first
It doesn't matter how the patient is

And yes, if you have mediclaim, don't tell me, the money doubles here... (of the bill).

Now fix it sir

My treatment was Dr. I started with Shailendra Pawar, thank you very much, his consultation is very good and correct, he did not ask for any kind of test for no reason, every time he adjusted his time according to our convenience.

Dr. Vivekananda Sanap's guidance for mother and baby after delivery is very good, every morning and evening without fail Sir comes for checkup.

The hospital staff is very professional and caring, sisters and aunts, mamas take care of us like family members. As it was our first time, we had many doubts about the baby, but they cleared all our doubts without any irritation.

We are grateful to the entire H3 family, thank you very much "
