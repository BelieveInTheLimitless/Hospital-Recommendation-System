5 stars,"I'm Dr.Prasanna phutane working as consultant psychiatrist
I was searching for the best obstetrician for my wife in my locality ( Kondhwa) where der are only handful one...After just 1 session only I decided to go for whole 9 month of consultation with Dr.Shrikant sir and Dr.Neha madam..
On sonography we came to know that we are having twins..It was challenging task to take the pregnancy beyond 28 weeks but due to doctors confidence it went till 36 weeks..Just now my wife delivered 2 beautiful twin baby boys..It's all due to positive moral support by the doctors & staff
Both doctors are having excellent surgical skills, soft spoken, good communication skills, well versed of medical knowledge.
One will get most genuine advise on all maternity issues..
Staff are the most cooperative in every sense...It's very hygienic place
If I have to rate it out of 10 I would give 10/10
I will recommend this hospital for all of your maternity, infertility issues
Just go for it!! "
5 stars,"I am writing when I experienced during my mother's treatment.
This hospital is specialized for women's illness, maternity, infertility..
This hospital have all the required facilities for operating.

I met doctor, I experienced his support, kindness as well as his talent. He is excellent in his specialized field.

Finally, all nurses and staff are supportive and kind too. They keep try to make patient happy whenever they communicate. Felt good about that.

I would like to prefer this hospital if any women ask me for her treatment.

5 stars,"I m from nashik, done my previous treatment till 7th month in nashik and had come to pune at my mother's home for delivery. Was looking for a hospital close to my home in kondhwa and found out about Khetmalas hospital and about the doctors great guidance.
I went in for my 9th month sonography and found out about the dropped water level and might affect baby's health. It was decided that I had to prepare almost a month before the EDD...and was admitted the next day...they tried for normal delivery for almost 14 hrs with various treatments they could provide but had to opt for C-section to avoid any complications...they are great doctors with vast knowledge and greater human beings. Provided support throughout the experience. Great staff who are willing to help you out any given time. I m really thankful to Dr. Shrikant Khetmalas and Dr. Neha Khetmalas for my beautiful baby Girl. "

We are blessed with a baby Boy, One month back. The way Dr. Shrikant Khetmalas handled my entire pregnancy and delivery was commendable. He never asked for unnecessary tests/scans.

5 stars,"One of the best hospitals I have even seen in Pune I have checked with more than four hospitals for my wife's pregnancy. 2 of them, like Bharti and Parasnis Hospital, scared us by saying that it was a high-risk pregnancy, so we showed up in Khetmal Hospital, and believe me, both Dr. Shrikant and Dr. Neha are the best in Pune. They told us all things correctly and properly. Where other hospitals were forcing and scaring us for Cesarean deliveries, Dr. Shrikant and Dr. Neha told us the truth, and they did a normal delivery. Thank God that we have chosen Khetmal Hospital. The environment is too good, and all areas are clean and neat, which is the best thing about this hospital, and also, I have no word regarding all the sisters and other doctors working there. All of those are very sweet and polite with patients and also with relatives. Believe me, you are never going to find hospitals with the best doctors and sisters like this. We lose hope for normal delivery, but Dr. Shrikanr was the person who gave us hope and did his work perfectly. He was like God to us in that situation. Talking about charges, I have made inquiries with more than 4 hospitals, and believe me, I got the lowest price list from this hospital. Thank you, Dr. Shrikant and Dr. Neha, for bringing happiness to our family. Highly recommended hospitals for pregnant women who don't want to get stuck between fake hospitals I have noticed one thing: other hospitals will work only for money, but Khetmal Hospital will see what is best for the mother and child. Thanks a lot.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è "
5 stars,"We had a good experience at khetmalas Hospital
( Dr. Neha khetmalas and Dr. Shrikant Khetmalas)
They are not only Doctor, they are good human beings, Kindly communicate and listen patiently and transparent process. All staff is very soft spoken and very hard working. First I approached to Hospital for having some stomach pain, they have properly diagnosed and suggested to do MRI and found that there is fibroid and operated it. Operation was laparoscopy that takes 3 hr as it was big fibroid, it was succefully done and recovered in short period of time.
After 6 months approached to conceive 2nd baby. Initially  we tried naturally for few months then we started treatment under Dr Neha and Dr Shrikant sir. Dr suggested to do HSG test to ensure fellopion tubes are open. Report was normal but I was facing some infection problem. initially Dr provided medicines but that doesn't resolve problem completely.¬† Dr suggested to do hystroscopy, that is done by Dr. Shrikant sir, found that there is polyp. Dr operated at that time in half an hour of time. It was totally done without pain.
Dr actually shows the findings of test during operation on screen, that's the difference in this hospital and other hospitals. After that infection problem resolved then tried naturally to conceive a baby but it was not successful so Dr suggested to do IUI. In first IUI is successful.. So rellay happy to suggest to peoples to take advantage of their services and facility.
Why to take service from them:
> Communication with Dr's on your problems will give you confidence,
> Dr gives you sufficient time to answer your questions
> Don't force you for any procedure only suggests good options
> Transferent process
> Services are value to money
> Offerdable charges
Thank You So Much Dr. Shrikant Sir and Dr. Neha Mam. "

5 stars,"They are the best Gyne I ever experienced‚Ä¶Before meeting with Dr.Neha Patil  and Dr. Shrikant Khetmalas , I have consulted with few other gyne who are just professional with their patients however Dr Neha & Dr. Shrikant are out of the world I would say, they not only listen everyone very patiently n calmly and give personal touch to all. .in spite of so many complications they managed so well and gave their o/s support all the time..Usually I have seen so many cases where patients wants normal delivery but doctors threaten them with so many issues n complications n patients has to agree for C sec but Dr Neha & Dr. Shrikant only prefer to do normal deliveries n tries their best till the end. I would recommend everyone to consult this doctor n get best advice all the time..

We Consulted Dr. Neha & Dr. Shrikant for entire 9 months of my pregnancy, we finally blessed with a healthy baby boy on Jan 15th by C-section under the supervision of Dr.Shrikant. From the starting they both guided us for healthy mother will have a healthy baby concept. In this entire period, I feel blessed with the support, guidance, care and the empathy of Dr.Neha & Dr. Shrikant, they are angels. I recommend them to all my friends and relatives. Whenever I visited Khetmalas Hospital I felt a new positivity and my energy level automatically gone up, In the beginning of my pregnancy there were times when I felt very nervous and low and I will give Dr.Neha & Dr. Shrikant all the credit for giving me the strength, positivity and utmost care, they treat all their patients like a family member and give all great advises with a big smile. I strongly recommended all to be moms to visit Khetmalas Hospital. Thank you. And God bless you Abundantly Dr Neha & Dr. Shrikant. "

5 stars,"Genuine review with bottom of my heart
We consulted with Dr Shrikant and Dr Neha for the entire 9 months of my pregnancy. We finally gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 16th 2022 by normal delivery under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Shrikant sir.

Dr. Shrikant sir listens to each patient patiently and calmly. They treat all their patients like family members and welcome all with a big smile and with greetings. He personally takes attention till discharge. Dr Shrikant and Dr Neha prefer to do normal deliveries and try their best until the very end. He gave me strength, positivity and care in my labor.

In addition to Dr Shrikant, I saw a few other gynecologists before Dr Shrikant. They were not able to provide adequate guidance. They are professional with their patients hence they are in a hurry to finish appointments; they are not clear our doubts.
However, Dr Shrikant and Dr Neha provide personalized attention to each patient and provide us with guidance, clear our doubts, and explain/share their knowledge with us. This helps us to enjoy the entire process.

They teach us from the beginning what to do for a normal delivery, what precautions to take, and which exercises are helpful.

Each time I visited for routine checkups and sonography in the past 9 months, I received detailed explanations of reports and all details about my baby growth. As a result, I enjoyed my first pregnancy and all the memorable experiences it brought.

About the staff:

All staff is supportive/helpful, excellent and they are always ready to help.

About the Hospital:

Hospital is clean and hygiene like our home,
The hospital is equipped with advanced equipment,
All tests, ultrasounds, Sonography, scans etc. All available under one roof,
Medical is available in same premises,
Hospital open 24*7,
All facilities are included in all rooms,
Families of patients have access to a kitchen as well.

It was a very good experience and I didn't feel like I was in a hospital at all. It‚Äôs like home.

There are not enough words to describe how thankful we are for your wonderful care during my pregnancy, labor & delivery.
Once again thanks Dr Shrikant sir and Dr Neha mam. "
