5 stars,"To be true to the experience out here had a very beautiful experience. My stay in dengue was very very good . Doctors are professional and specially the support stuff and the immense support and help at all times is very professional. It is not a place where they would want to extract money from you but will make sure you receive your due help and support altogether.
Had the best experience and was here for 5 days and Dr.Naseem is the backbone of this hospital and always a smiling and gracious lady at your service. "

5 stars,"Olive Hopsital did a great job with my first ever maternity experience . The doctors were well experienced, and trained specially Dr Sushmita Nimbalkar who gave us the confidence and support throughout our maternity journey, and did a normal delivery. The hospital staff explained everything to me in a very clear manner. Other staff was also kind and friendly. All of the staff was great – they were helpful, patient and helped with my insurance.
Thank you. "

5 stars,"I am highly delighted to share my views for Dr. Nasim’s Olive Hospital, Kausar Baugh Pune, is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my mother in law’s health (Mariyam Khatri), but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment.  It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend to my friends and relatives to this Olive Hospital, Kausar Baugh Pune. Hospital’s staff is also very concerned and helpful. Overall a great experience. "

5 stars,"Got my plate removal surgery done here and I am thoroughly impressed with this hospital. Dr Imran Shaikh who operated me is a very experienced orthopaedic surgeon. He clearly communicated the current situation of mine and gave me all the options available for treatment. The entire staff is extremely caring and helpful. The facility itself is very well maintained and clean. The doctors also visit the patient regularly and keep a check on the patient's progress and recovery. They also suggest if any changes are to be made in the recovery schedule of the patient based on the current situation.

I would certainly recommend this hospital for any orthopedic or sports injury related issues. "

1 star,"Doesn't deserve even a star. Faculty is good, even the hospital is even good but as far as, it comes on the level of treatment it is just a place to stack money from the patients. Treatment given just to increase Dr' s visit, per day charge, and so on. I was admitted in the hospital but they just took 15,000k from me without me being cured.  I was in the same condition the day I was admitted in the hospital when I came back home.Even after being discharge, the dr charges for his visit. I was not even given the pathology bills. I was not made aware of the reports for the test done. Basically it was just a scam which the hospital has performed.  Kindly do not go to the hospital 🙏 for the treatment in case to save money, just avoid  Olive Hospital. "
5 stars,"I had a large cyst on my right ovary which had to be operated, my gynaecologist dr. Sushmita Nimbalkar was excellent she explained the procedure very well.

5 stars,"I would recommend Olive Hospital for the best service I received!  I had been suffering since a few days of dizziness in the head and Dr. Nasim rightly guided me to get my tests done at their facility, the process was very smooth and fast besides it was very reasonable as well.  I was surprised to see that they returned 20/- Rs back as the bill was corrected.  This honesty is rare in any institution leave alone hospitals, which have now become merely commercial establishments with no emotional connect.  The test results are very easy to get on to your mobile by scanning the barcode on the report, which helps a great deal.  Thank you for everything Olive MH. "
