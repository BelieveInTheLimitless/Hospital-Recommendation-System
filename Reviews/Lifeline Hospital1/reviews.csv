Rating,Review
5 stars,Very good hospital. Dr. Haseeb is very great doctor. Had a treatment for my backpain and got the result quickly. And Physiotherapist Dr Asma is also great. Had physiotherapy here for my backpain which helped me a lot for speedy recovery. Staff is very good. 
1 star,"Doctors have helping hand and listen problems calmly, but staff is too worst.. they are busy in their own gossip but not concerned about patient.. If you are waiting then you can wait for whole day right Infront of them but they will say just 2 minute ,sir just 2 minute .. "
1 star,Bad Experience! I think the maagment is only money minded and by just simply any cause they try to take hndsome amount for the people who ever visit there. Doubt whether they really have good team of Doctors?? 
1 star,Dr. Haseeb shaikh he is worst doctor i have ever met. He doesn't have any knowledge and cannot diagnose properly. I had an ligament injury which i have consulted with him but he doesn't responded actively and diagnosed very carelessly he even didn't see my reports properly and diagnosed very carelessly. He doesn't even listen to his patient carefully. He is very careless and a worst doctor i would never recommend anybody to go in lifeline hospital because there is no  proper doctor or staff to deal with patient. I wish i could give 0 but i don't have the option.He even doesn't provide any direction at all and upon asking he doesn't respond in a good way. He is very unprofessional. 
4 stars,"It has been an excellent experience at Lifeline Hospital.
Dr. Haseeb is a well experienced (ortho) doctor and has treated me very well.
In fact, my daughter, who met with a severe accident few years back was also very well handled by him.
Dr. Asma, the Physio, has been very cooperative and did her best.
I have no hesitation in recommending Lifeline Hospital for any medical needs. "
4 stars,"Dr. Haseeb(ortho) is a great doctor! Heâ€™s very understanding and listens to your concerns. He takes time with the patient to help them with their health issues!
My daughter, who met with a severe accident few days back was also very well handled by him.
It was a good experience at Lifeline Hospital. "
5 stars,I had met with an accident I couldn't lift my right Dr Haseeb saw the x ray told me relax nothing to worry prescribed tablets told me to go to the physio therapist Dr Asma she is wonderful made me do some exercises on third day I could lift my hand very good therapis. Perfect diagnosis by Dr Haseeb even today my wife cannot stand having terrible pain in her right leg he's giving her treatment & physio therapy I sure she will recover. Dr Haseeb is well experienced orthopedic. 
4 stars,"Hospital is so nice

5 stars,Physiotherapy treatment is good and hospital has all required equipments. Was suffering from knee pain and Dr. Afreen diagnosed it via physiotherapy in very few days  sessions. 
5 stars,I don't know about other negative reviews posted so far. however I have just been discharged ( Sept 2021 ) and my experience was much positive. Dr Inamdar was very professional.  Staff was friendly and caring.  Cleanness was taken seriously. My overall bill was unexpectedly low.  I am here writting this review after getting cured. 
5 stars,"It's a good hospital there are new changes being added to the hospital,I am undergoing treatment for my back pain with Dr hasib shaikh and taking physiotherapy with  Dr Afrin ,I would like to say she is good with her work knows whats good for the patient and takes an extra effort to treat them very well and takes her work very seriously , make  the person understand the root causes of problems and give solutions to it which every patient wants to hear, rarely you find doctor's who actually try to help you in best way possible. "
5 stars,"My father was diagnosed with extreme pneumonia and covid complications. I went to national and sana hospital in Kondhwa but they couldn't diagnose it. After getting frustrated by the treatment we came here and we are very happy with the manner of doctor. They spoke very politely with all the calmness.
I'm impressed by the hospitality and management of the hospital. They handled it very well and cured it with a very calming manner. The best part is the transparency they communicate all the things to patients and relative. Very genuine treatment. And the bill is much lower than other hospitals in Kondhwa. Very effective treatment with genuine helps from doctors. Also the Staff is very good special mention of afsar he is very supportive and manages all the things really well. Highly recommend this hospital. Best treatment in Kondhwa at a very reasonable price "
1 star,"I'm typing this review at 1.30am just because I don't want anyone else to face the same I did .. don't GO on sweet words of
Dr.Aliya Inamdar ...now she Have her own clinic Right infront of this hospital ..she was ONCE WORKING Here ..

I went To her for My wife's Pragnancy Her weight was 70Kgs at 2 months of pragnancy She made her delicate darling and put her on bed rest But there was no complications nothing She and my baby is Fit and healthy ..

She also Said that My wife Will gain weight till 90Kgs at the time of delivery and it's Normal ..
My wife Asked several time To start pragnancy exercises but she refused and said she will let Her know when to start but never allowed till 7th month of pragnancy and also Not started Thyroid medicine at 3month of pragnancy when Thyroid Was detected ..always Said It's mild and no need to worry about..

HER ONLY MOTO WAS To make My wife gain weight till delivery so that she can Make us count complications and Loot US BY DOING C-SECTION ..

We changed 2 more doctors after her To find a Loyal Honest doctor ..

Now she will be delivering soon
But as she already Gained 90kgs There is no chance To reduce the weight But all we can do is Make People aware About HER ..

Please Don't fall in her trap "
4 stars,Doctor is good. Overall facilities are good. 
1 star,"Giving 1 star, since there is no option of 0.
Dr. Munaf Inamdar, one of the worst doctor, does not have manners to talk to people. He is treating people as if he is doing it for free. Doesn't provide any directions at all, upon asking your own health condition he will get angry.
He must learn good communication skills.
If you wanna push your BP high and get insulted then ""THIS DOCTOR IS FOR YOU"". "
1 star,"Most pathetic hosp without proper sanitization or hospital staff, While they charge you and ask you to get stuffs used in your procedure like suction tip etc and that too from the pharmacy linked with them

My advice is that Please go to Inamdar Multispeciality hospital or Sana hospital instead . They are within 2-3 kms range in Kondhwa ! "
5 stars,"Dr. Munaf Inamdar, is an excellent doctor and good professionalist.
