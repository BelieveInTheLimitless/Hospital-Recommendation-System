1 star,"Third class grade hospital.
You will be questioned same questions by 5-6 people while admitting. File is most important than your treatment.

RMOs are least bothered, reluctant.
Security guards feels like they are
owner. During doctors round in pediatric ward only one parent is allowed to
stand. How can one parent take decision of child. And baby can be managed. They will come in crowd.

You keep requesting but staff is like VIP. Try not to visit again. "
1 star,"If had minus star will be rated alot changed after 2019 ,worst  hospital seen ,all there doctor are not doctor but student .
I was having  left hand shoulder pain which was server  they even can't diagnoise properly operator of sonography as such new that he even can't handle one old lady patient on songraphy room I waited over 2:30 hr for just songraphy . Even worst think no management and too costly Charitable should remove from the name of this hospital .

Worst worst and most worst think is that they have tie with badass pharmaceutical companies to sell heavy costly drug for every patient  who has minor pain or symptoms ,prescribed medicine will not get in any medical or rare chance

Due to the wrong medication got skin allergic  on same hand which was in pain. My condition is even getting worst due to heavy rashes on left hand ,no relief in pain but increased .

Due to which with heavy fever ,heavy pain in left shoulder and rashes had done salting work in it . Now straight forward admitted me into one of private hospital in locatilty .

Hope guys this review will enough who dones't have insurance or filty pocket or more and more money or else even upper middle classe will crushed by their bill, management and doctor Sorry I mean student doctor just for chair they sign in OPD and seat in their special cabin for so call lectures "
1 star,"Very worst experience  have faced in hospital this time and lost my father because of the negligence of the staff  . Twice or thrice in ICU there was not even a single staff , informed many times to the incharge but no improvement .How can they all went for the break at the same time.

Twice patients condition went to crictical and i personally informed to Dr at chanrge as no nurse or brother in the supprounding   though patient was in ICU.

Each day they asked for different treatment , we just asked to show the medical reports but they denied , not even single time they shown us the report file ,  this is totally wron as its rights for the relatives to know what r the reports and what will b the future treatment .

During admission also they wasted lot of time and not decided among themselfs to admit under which department . "

1 star,"Careless staff starting from parking. Visit charges and other hidden charges is so much higher. Do not refer to anybody. All government scheames is not devoped here as per government rules. Hospital is founded for money making only. They have no care about patient. They want only taking care of theire money. Intrested in money only.
I was admitted in hospital. Wrost experience from neurology reception dept. Mrs. Rupali Patil. She dont know OPD Doctor is available or not at theire cabin also. In face patil madam is sitting in front of doctor's cabin. "
1 star,I was admitted for surgery when I contacted office for mahatma phule yojna person told first do process then apply for scheme. When I followed it and did surgery and went to ask about phule yojna.. They are saying why didn't you fill form first before surgery now it's not possible to apply scheme. Shocking service 
1 star,"Writing review after 3 recent experience. The hospital is no more trustworthy, avoid going.
They unnecessarly make to pay more by giving false advise to admit or tests or checkups by any possible means.
I'm charged with 2k for govt approved child vaccine which should be free. Also they mandatorily take doctor consultation charges there even if it's routine child vaccine and you don't want consultation. "
1 star,"Worst experience , Dr are not looking into patients ans rely on their assistant to take decision.
Those assistant Dr to nor educated , we need to tell them what medicines used for what purpose .
Brothers , sisters Neglecting patients in ICU , and roaming here and there , taking break at same time.
Many times complaint to main icu in c
harge but no luck .. Bad experience. "
4 stars,"New multispeciality hospital has good facilities, good cleanliness, and diligent service.

Lifts/Elevators are very less and insufficient considering the rush.

Parking near the OPD building is an embarassing experience. "
2 stars,The hospital is good but the doctors are very trainees.Experience doctors also come to see patients according to their time 
1 star,Very bad behavior from lady mrs. Ashwini Tambe. She behaves rudly like no washrooms are allowed to 6 no ward relatives on 3rd floor. It's very bad system that she behaving with patients/ relatives. Such kind of persons will always works with bad habits. That they do not showing human being to other's in a hospital or any such kind of places. It's  shameful for our hospital that she doesn't allow to use washroom. But allow only for sleeping. Shame.. shame.. shame...

4 stars,Bharati hospital is one of the best hospitals in the area with all the critical medical facilities available for the patient. Hospital is easily reachable in and around katraj area. The hospital has medical and nursing College too in the campus. 
1 star,"It's the worst hospital .
They just want to charge patient unnecessarily and make money.
I visited this hospital for my granny for the check-up, doctor inform they need to do some test for that they are charging rs4000. I completely understand but for the injection they are charging rs8000.
As per the nurse patient was having internal bleeding, to stop that they have to give that injection. It's a whole lie.
If the patient had internal bleeding she wouldn't able to eat. (They haven't gave that injection).
Please do not visit this hospital.
The name says it's a charitable trust hospital.
No it's not they just want to money from poor people.
They have made this hospital a profit making organisation. "
3 stars,"BHARATI HOSPITAL is a 200-beded, multi-specialty Hospital located in Saraipali town of Mahasamund District (Chhattisgarh). The foundation was laid by Mr. Viswajit Gupta under guidance of Shri Jaynarayan Gupta & Dr. Bharat Kumar Gupta with a view to provide cost-effective, high-quality medical services, at par with Corporate Hospitals for the general public.

Within a radius of 60 km surrounding Saraipali, with a population of about 10 lakhs , there is virtually no basic, healthcare facility. There are many situations where the local people have suffered due to lack of immediate, medical attention or regular and timely monitoring. This was frequently happening on account of distance, non-availability of transportation, lack of healthcare facilities and financial inability to access emergency health facilities. We have now attempted to mitigate this problem by providing healthcare services to the under-served surroundings of SARAIPALI, for all sections, with proper infrastructure, equipment, skilled and experienced doctors and paramedical staff.

Bharati Hospital is ideally located in the heart of the Saraipali town and is easily accessible to the neighboring areas. The Hospital is equipped with the latest, hi-tech, precision instruments, modern infrastructure, good trauma and critical-care facilities, three ‘state of art’ Operation Theatres, latest diagnostic services, comfortable and homely ‘in-patient’ facilities and ambience, ‘round-the-clock’ patient-care and monitoring.

The campus inculcates the facility of Diet canteen along with an eco-friendly atmosphere for the patients , staffs, doctors & attendants. The Hospital shall provide ‘round the clock’ services and will cater to the health needs of the public of the entire SARAIPALI belt of Mahasamund district, Chhattisgarh and other contiguous areas.

Standby power generators with protective ‘Online’ UPS systems have been made available. The Central Sterilization Department, for infection control ,has been established to meet the demands of all departments. A ‘Lift’ facility makes life easier for non-ambulatory patients. A Dialysis unit for kidney ailments is also available for regular, patient treatment. The hospital also provides living-quarters for essential staff such as Doctors and other paramedical staff.

It may be noted that there is no modern, medical diagnostic centre in the in the entire district. To address this lacunae, the hospital has established good, diagnostic services by acquiring advanced diagnostic equipment. This includes radiology, ultrasound, ECG and other automatic Analyzers. "
1 star,"Terrible Hospital, whole hospital is ruined by trainee doctor with uneducated staff. No Sr. Dr is available to tell or ask something. The trainee would suggest a major treatment which is inappropriate. Doesn’t have internal communication between doctor and trainee . Senior says another thing and Trainee another . It’s hospital duty to provide gloves and masks to doctor but here we have to buy and give them . Sister’s  over here are slow than turtle . Sometimes, Doctor ignores the patient. "
1 star,"Pathetic hospital .. they only loot people. For all illness/discomfort (even minor) they ask you to get hospitalized. They first ask people to pay deposit of 5 k/10k, then scare them stating extreme consequences. they dont handover patient's reports, medical papers or prescription. If you care for your life, please don't go here ever. "
3 stars,"One of the cleanliest and best in patient care and treatment. All facilities under one roof.
Parking for Patients and relatives is a major pain, worst managed and pulls down the rating of the hospital.
Looks like management is ignoring the feedback given by patients for a long time. "
1 star,"Worst experience in general ward, process is very slow. Staff say we hav not give PEGASTA injection which is given after 24 hours chemo therapy. However on 24 September and 15 October 2022 they had given the injection. "
1 star,"Worst hospital with worst staff and inexperienced doctors
The doctors are usually the students who study in their deemed university and are not well trained at all
Wouldn't recommend for any sensitive treatments
They charge heavily for tests like sonography, xray etc
As the doctors are inexperienced, they would prescribe unnecessary medication and tests
Don't risk your life "

So My suggestion to people is not to go with bharti hospital for spine surgery please🙏🏻
Thank you "
4 stars,"The college is good and prestigious however the teaching staff is not.

The hospital is good and well equipped , basically all they instruct you is to administer pain killers and how to increase bills when you work in private sector.

Apart from all these factors it's a good college. Nice campus and well equipped labs and ot's. Plenty of case study and quite nice examination patterns .

Hostel life is good but most students prefer to stay off campus. "

1 star,Got an appointment for 10:00 AM today for endoscopy…despite long wait due to emergency patient finally it’s done at 11:30 and was told to collect report in 1 hr or before 6PM today.

This hospital is run by 16 year olds. Not a single senior doctor available.
Shameful.
They should be shut down. Only in India can such establishments survive. I don't even want to imagine the number of people they'd have killed by negligence till now. "
3 stars,"Doctors and medical staff is good but people at security level are very bad in terms of behaviour, they trouble you as if we are some criminals. I feel they are not fair with everyone, I am really not happy with it. As the family of the patient i think atleast I can't handle stress from security staff. "

I have been waiting for about more than 2 hours for ENT doctor kaushik maitri, but all other patients are prioritiesd and treated. I have told to nurses we have waiting for more than 2 hours but no one helped. I don't asked the money also which I have used to registed. Pathetic Service "
1 star,"I didn't even feel like giving this one star for the experience at the radiology department.
Few days back my mother was struck with a paralysis stroke (and if you know paralysis strikes the left side of the body), she was sent to the from the emergency ward at midnight around 1:30am. She had an urge to pee and was asking for a bed pan.
But the nurses there started making excuses, we don't have a bed pan in the department/there's no aya available and nonsense excuses for that matter.

She was cringing in pain due to not being able to control her bladder while me literally going around asking for bedpan because the staff was reluctant, she peed in the stretcher in her clothes.
She was then taken for CT scan and MRI in the same condition.
I am disgusted with this inhuman service.

I would appreciate the doctors and their medical attention but the sisters/nurses have no ethics and are inhuman for that matter. "

1 star,Worst hospital for covid..staff is very ignorant...no one knows which doctor is giving treatment...they talk about their protocols and don't even follow one. Highly ignorant. The patient was laying on his bed with saline leaking still no one attended him for 2 hours...doctors don't even share patient's reports with their relatives...one of my friend received a call that patient was missing...was shocked to hear that staff isn't even aware and don't even respond when they are called to help by the oatient...will never visit bharati hospital again ! Very unhappy with the service..all reports are also fake(have  substantial proof) 
2 stars,There was Dr and senior Dr was good in that his own work but specially sister and other social worker of that in hospital is very worst only shouted and speaking in bad language of patients relatives.we are very disappointed of NICU WARD there was internal staff not support to relative only say pay advance amount of treatment otherwise we can't do your patient treatment now

1 star,Good hospital in terms of response from Doctors and other staff however very horrible experience from Cashier (specially the one seats at admission counter) wherein he asks bank account pin number while payment and on denial he insists for the same and keeps arguing and demanding for the ATM Pin. This is really serious and hospital trust should immediately take strong actions against these peoples. 
2 stars,I had very worst experience n i do regrete on my decesion to choose Bharti hosp only name indicates charitable but actually they dont charge like charitable...there is pure loot in the bill of Medications n ICU  charges for a common man who doesnt afford hence common man choose the charitable hosp...the picture is completely opposite n horrible...they should add horrible instead of charritable hosp.....i will never ever recomend anybody to this hosp....i have given 2 stars out of which one star for the Gynac OPD Dept.For Kavita mam n Gynacologist for their coordination n service..... another for all Jr.Sr. gynac Drs.. who treated me...but the management....i give minus points....without any kind of intimation to patient they start treatment and at the time of discharge they follow the formality of addmission  example conset form should be fill n show to the patient time of addmission .. so that they can decide are they gonna  afford this or not  are they want to continue treatment here or not under the name of critical condition ...they use to loot the poor patients... i am going to take serious action on the management i must say our past exp that is 10 -15 years ago...there was top facilities in minimal charges and use to give excellent services.....and now complete picture is opposite....n i ll take all nececssary actions on it... 
1 star,"I want to share my experience about emergency ward. Too high means very much high charges for scan things. Not cooperative at all. Without  looking the patient condition, list of things to be scanned are given. In prediction these guys are awesome. After 4 5 scan then saying this was not necessary. Cleanliness is ok but showoff and high end charges pathetic. Businesses hospital. "
5 stars,Best hospital. Best service. Good staff. Friendly doctors. My bro ganesh nerkar was admitted for 6 day's for skin problem. He  and me are very thankful to all of you... thank you so much for good treating... meal also good. And Cleanliness also good bed ward all things...

Within a week time he found infected with pseudomonas bacteria, again they have admitted my father for 10 days for treatment and discharged saying it was cured.

Worst part is, in the blood and other reports which was done at time interval of 20 days, only date is changed other results are exactly copy of each other. We suspect they have only changed the date on the report.

3 stars,"Hospital is meant for hospitality and is quite enough. But patient's relative attendants have very poor facilities. Washrooms are insufficient and pretty dirty while housekeeping records are up to date. Hospital has proud to outsource the hospitality services from most reputed agencies like BVG but still the utilities for attendants and relatives is not even satisfactory to use. Surprisingly the toilets in front of the hospitality office is the best example for review.
Now a days many private medical stores offering discounts on medicines. Medical store in campus charges MRP. Being charitable hospital generic medicines are to be promoted for the benefit of needy and poor families.
Food available in canteens may be good but not for patients. These are running totally business and not for hospitalized patients.
Otherwise everything is the best....

Best option to purchase Medicines is "" SAI MEDICAL"" just on left  road of this hospital. Fifty percent discount. "
2 stars,Cost of treatment is very high here. hospital is quite good maintained but the doctors here are not very cooperative.They charge very high for everything.if your hands are fractured they will charge you 15000-17000 rs and will keep you in hospital for 1 week without any reason and charge you for no reasons.if you don't have any other choice you can come here for medical treatment

1 star,"They will sicken an already sick person and won't let them recover. My father could have just been given oxygen for 3-4 hours and should have been allowed to go once the SpO2 levels normalised. But they wanted to make money, so asked me to keep him ICU for 1 day and every other day asked to keep him for one more day. They wouldn't let him move around and treated him like bed ridden, come on he walked himself to the hospital bed from home. I told them this treatment is making him more sick. So i decided to take him home and he turned out alright after that. During discharge I asked them to give the patient file but they denied they said it's hospitals property. I told them I don't understand how you have anything to do with the file after the patient is discharged. But i know they just keep this so that nobody can question their treatment and file a case against them. They even lost my father's old reports. Just don't go their, it's a nightmare. "

Spacial is a woman who considers herself to be very oversmart. General ward patients are charged with ICU. 10 thousand a day bill for covid and give only 2 pills a day. If the patient is discharged today, they call him back tomorrow and ask him to admit him again. Not talking about mediclaim.. There are some doctors who can't spell medicine correctly. 10 After going through the medical, I realized that the spelling is wrong. They are just sitting to collect money. The staff does not have the sense to speak properly at all.
