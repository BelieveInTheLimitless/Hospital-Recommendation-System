1 star,"Rude receptionist with no care
Sitting casually when on emergency was told to call the Dr, called the Dr after 10-15 mins of tests done by nurse
Rooms in shabby condition

Drs in emergency not being techno savvy wants reports in black white printed format only when reports already being sent on cell phone.
Too expensive for such kind of treatment service. "
1 star,"Don't believe this lady. yesterday my father was visit Shahade hospital . We were asked to draw different types of reports even when there was no treatment facility available . We also had earlier hospital report. After all these reports were removed ,she end of the day said that we would not be treated .Even though she did not have the treatment ,she was asked to spend the extra money to remove the reports also charged one day hospital admission ,consultancy fee. "
