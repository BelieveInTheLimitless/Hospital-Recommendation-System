1 star,"Very bad service at this hospital...staff is very rude and not coprative...there voice is too much loud while talking with patients and relatives... especially that ""vaishali mavshi""..her behaviour really disappoints me...don't be too much rude...
Doctor's are good and caring also but staff is not proper they really behaves very badly ..
Worst experience I could ever have with staff service...
Dear doctor's plz change your staff or else tell them to be polite with patients and relatives....

1 star,"Third Class Hospital. No one should go in the Chavan Hospital Nr. Navle Bridge. Very  Bad service.

If You really want to improve your service at the time of non-admission of Pation.  Please give either Cash refund and bill or Medicine.  I have not received any of them. I have requested lady doctor to give medicine, but she has not agreeed . In that case I have paid the AMT. But we have not received medicine at the time of non-admission.
Just think over it.  Money is Money
It's humble request that don't cheat with anybody....
Thanks  .

Hello.  Doctor Sir,

If you really want to improve your service give me my cash as refund purpose. Dt. 22/03/2021, You have taken 800 /- from me without the bill for medicine purpose only & I have decided not to admit in same hospital. That time you have denied to give the medicine. If not medicine you could have provided me my cash itself.

If you really want to improve your service give me my cash back. RS 800 /-

Thanks & Regards,
