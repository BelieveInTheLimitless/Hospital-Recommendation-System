1 star,"Third Class Hospital. No one should go in the Chavan Hospital Nr. Navle Bridge. Very  Bad service.

If You really want to improve your service at the time of non-admission of Pation.  Please give either Cash refund and bill or Medicine.  I have not received any of them. I have requested lady doctor to give medicine, but she has not agreeed . In that case I have paid the AMT. But we have not received medicine at the time of non-admission.
Just think over it.  Money is Money
It's humble request that don't cheat with anybody....
Thanks  .

Hello.  Doctor Sir,

If you really want to improve your service give me my cash as refund purpose. Dt. 22/03/2021, You have taken 800 /- from me without the bill for medicine purpose only & I have decided not to admit in same hospital. That time you have denied to give the medicine. If not medicine you could have provided me my cash itself.

If you really want to improve your service give me my cash back. RS 800 /-

Thanks & Regards,

Uday Deshmukh "

5 stars,"Our patient was admitted at Mangala Dandge Chavan Hospital when he was admitted in ICU his condition was a bit serious but the doctor and all the staff handled the situation very well and soon stabilized him properly.. and he was given general word soon after a day. Shifted in. We have brought the patient here for second admission. Everyone is cooperating very well
Dr. Purva and Dhanashree Sister were very helpful, after seeing them I felt like a part of our family and they took care of our patients so well. "
5 stars,"My grandmother was admitted to Gangu Shinde Chavan Hospital for treatment. The doctors at the hospital started treatment immediately and my grandmother's health improved quickly. The staff there were also very prompt and attentive. Patient was interrogated with indifference. And specialists doctor was also calling for treatment.
And even in Beela, no extra charges were applied for no reason, my grandmother received good and excellent treatment in Chavan Hospital in budget.
So I will suggest others to seek treatment at Chavan Hospital. "
