5 stars,"Underrated hospital on Sinhgad Road, Dhayari area. I had been treated for food poisoning recently there and it was a good experience. They gave me a special Room which was really good with a bathroom attached and an electric geyser for hot water. AC too (it didn't give cool air though ;)

Most importantly, they were in my cashless network of hospitals covering insurance. I didn't have to pay any money. And discharge too was quick and hassle free. Thank you. "
5 stars,"My son admitted last 3 days in Morya hospital. My experience is very good. All the staff is very cooperative and polite including nursing staff, cleaning staff, administration.
Dr Kulkarni is well experienced and of very helpful nature.
Even on duty doctors are also attending every small issue without any hesitation.
Overall experience is good "

1 star,"This is not a hospital but just a vaccination center. No one in the hospital cares about the patient care. I never saw any opd doctor in the hospital, only nursing staff sees the patients and provide wrong diagnosis.
I went there for fungal infection bit the so called doctor said, it's just a corn and sked to ignore or apply a corn cap. Now the infection has spread all over my toes.
These people are hungry for money. It's not a hospital, it's just a business.

Highly recommend to not visit this hospital at all instead you can treat yourself much better than these fraudsters. "

1 star,"one of the worst hospital in near by areas, don't  visit and waste your valuable  money.
we were admitted  here for five days due to high fever. doctors failed to find the actual reason  behind high fever. just they were trying to admit  patient  for more days without  proper treatment.
also at the time of discharge they charged extra price over mrp of medicines.

finally after 5 days of worst treatment , we were go to deenanath hospitals and they diagnose properly within a one day in the half price of morya hospital.

4 stars,"The place shows up on the Cowin portal for vaccination and it's a centrally located place right opposite Abhiruchi Mall. The place is not the ground floor but on the first floor. You can get a 2 wheeler parking easily but not for 4 wheeler.

The process for tokens is not followed properly with people taking 4 family members on a single token. So don't feel great in case you see a less number on your token. Look at the crowd and calculate time for your turn. Sometimes people will appear saying they have taken a token 2 hrs before you and you will have to make way or argue and negotiate with the person. The person giving the token will not help.

The overall experience is okay. The team responsible for giving vaccine is decent and they know the job. I hope they also tell the people that after vaccination you need to wait some time. People were leaving immediately.

If you ask for a receipt they will issue a handwritten one. They accept UPI payments and cash.

Charges are as per the Govt mandated rates for Covid vaccination.

I went for Covishield, they have both options do check before you make an appointment on the Cowin portal. "
4 stars,Process was good. Took only 5 minute to get vaccinated. Few thing observed. No social distancing observed. People were throwing cotton swabs on floor and staircase. But that is not hospital problem. But actually cleanliness should be our problem. 
5 stars,Took both of my vaccination doses at this hospital. It was a smooth experience and vaccines were almost painless. The hospital is quiet and clean. 
5 stars,"Our Vaccination process was quick and easy.
Great Staff "
5 stars,"Had very nice experience, took hardly 10 mins to complete the process, very neat and clean, very cordial staff "

The hospital location is very very easily accessible and is on main road so can get help immediately. "
3 stars,"Second vaccination taken here, very good process followed. Injection was giv n in very nice way as if nothing is injected into my skin, no pain no sensation...very good "
1 star,hopeless service......online booking available.but when you reached there..booster dose is not available....you can see board available in front of gate but when you enter there will be no booster dose...hopeless service....dont schedule your dose in morya hospital 
4 stars,Got vaccinated for Dose 2. Very clean hospital and all arrangements are nicely done. It's not time consuming if you choose morning slot. 
5 stars,"Vaccine for Covid19.
Smooth no rush process. All staff cooperative and guiding for easy going.
If need to get vaccinated early do visit. "
5 stars,"The staff was always helpful and kind. They ensured I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up. I am so glad I chose Morya hospital and would highly recommend to anyone.... "
1 star,Strongly not recommended for Covid vaccine. No Covid protocol followed here. They will make you sit at 10 different chairs in 20/25 minutes as if we are playing musical chair. Worst waiting management can be seen here. No one wears masks. Not eve head Dr Patil. When I asked him about this. He said as he was talking hence he removed the mask. This is epic. They charge 2 percent on card payment. Seen three patients fighting for the payment. It's unhygienic and risk here. Please find better place than this for paid vaccine.

1 star,"We were suppose to shift the patient to morya hospital as there were no icu beds in jupiter hospital, as soon as the ambulance arrived in jupiter, Jupiter hospital some how managed to give the patient a bed in icu. Now the ambulance driver forced us to pay them 2500 rupees as the ambulance had travelled from morya hospital to Jupiter hospital distance of 17 kms . I don't understand that how a hospital can charge for the ambulance so much when it's not used by the patient . One more thing the management of morya hospital asked the patient relative to deposit 100000 rupees in cash and only then they will see the patient and they also said they are not gonna give any guarantee. Not a good statement from a hospital . The case was diagnosed with pneumonia and needed good icu care . As per the pictures provided by the hospital on google I don't think it's a good decision to shift to morya hospital for major medical conditions . For minor conditions one can surely visit . Kindly improve your communication skills and charge ethically . Thankyou "

1 star,"We were suppose to shift the patient to morya hospital as there were no icu beds in jupiter hospital, as soon as the ambulance arrived in jupiter, Jupiter hospital some how managed to give the patient a bed in icu. Now the ambulance driver forced us to pay them 2500 rupees as the ambulance had travelled from morya hospital to Jupiter hospital distance of 17 kms . I don't understand that how a hospital can charge for the ambulance so much when it's not used by the patient . One more thing the management of morya hospital asked the patient relative to deposit 100000 rupees in cash and only then they will see the patient and they also said they are not gonna give any guarantee. Not a good statement from a hospital . The case was diagnosed with pneumonia and needed good icu care . As per the pictures provided by the hospital on google I don't think it's a good decision to shift to morya hospital for major medical conditions . For minor conditions one can surely visit . Kindly improve your communication skills and charge ethically . Thankyou "
5 stars,Very nice staff ... Quick vaccination process.

1 star,"Not satisfied with the services by this hospital.They not clarify before and after discharge the charges or everything also consultation is not proper so please stay away from this hospital.
Eventhough they treated me by RMOs but Dr
Shilpa Patil whose name mentioned on consultant and discharge card she doesn't came to check single time .Also diagnosed kito acidosis but I checked to another hospital that was nil ...ketone not present in urine .And insurance part was another thing for coz only treatment expenses. For fever treatment OPD dr ask to admit .And doctor told +++ kitone is present in urine  that's why I told to them give me discharge I want to take treatment in another hospital.

Hope they will understand the concern and try to treat diagnose properly to patients. "
