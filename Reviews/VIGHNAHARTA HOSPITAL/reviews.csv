1 star,"Actually not even 1star
They give bit treatment and charges a big amount
I was admitted at 4pm and discharged on 11pm same day,
Still they made a bill is R 5750
In that 3 saline+1-2 injection per saline

And afterall no improvement...
Waste of money once okay with there should be improvement which is not their...
Don't go... "
1 star,"😡😡😡
WARNING - DON'T GO
Waste of money
They will charge you for the tests not done there.... 200 Rs per big saline bottle which costs 32 Rs only....
And Nursing charges plus they will add injection injecting charges separately.... Why charging separately for nurse and injection?
🤬😡😠 "

1 star,"It is not a hospital for paying one star...people decide by looking at it.....they spend days just sitting there, a lot of time passes during discharge, gents are also admitted in the ladies ward, the staff are only those who have given good reviews. Should be, the cost of 3 days is literally 19000 rupees, "
