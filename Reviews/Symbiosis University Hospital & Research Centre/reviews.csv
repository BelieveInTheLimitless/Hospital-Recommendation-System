Symbiosis Hospital provides excellent medical facility at almost no cost. In case you have a college or a local ID, the checkups and tests are free with a really good and well maintained supporting staff. Went for covid vaccine. No words for campus. It's huge, well maintained and peaceful. Process was smooth and staff helpful. "
5 stars,"Nice experience at the Symbiosis Hospital Lavale for my 1st dose vaccination . Walk - Ins okay ( please call ahead before going and check exact hours ) . Saw the Symbiosis Hospital campus & medical college for the first time . Quite impressive setup.

Last Monday, I got the vaccination done in this hospital.The hospital staff is very cooperative at the vaccination center.

If we need Aadhar card or PAN card at the vaccination center then we have to carry it along with us.

The cost of the vaccine is ‚Çπ780.Take ‚Çπ59 for pill medicine.

After taking the vaccine, they also give you a certificate and tell you all the details when you have to come next time?

UPI,Cash, google pay. Phone pay Can you deposit money on any of these?

After taking the vaccine, there is a rest for 20:25 minutes.

Vaccines are given in the shoulder, so it is better if you wear clothes that are loose fitting.

The vaccination time is from morning to evening. "
5 stars,"Yesterday, I got vaccinated at the Symbiosis University Hospital. I reached there 15 min before my vaccination slot. The process was really really smooth right from the where to park the vehicle to the entire vaccination process.

Kudos to the entire Staff working  for this amazing deeds.

Here are few Highlights

1) The hospital was maintained very clean,

2) social distancing was maintained

3) The staff was very cooperative

4) They also have all pharmacy where you can take medicines after vaccination

5) All types of payment options are available

6) They keep you for 30 Min Observation

I find No Cons at all.

Great Staff, Great Work

Hope This Helps....

5 stars,"Went here for Vaccination. Overall experience was really good though there was some delay.
Well organised and supportive staff. Points to keep in mind.
- Car parking ground is bit far away from vaccination centre, however they provide a shuttle van from parking to hospital.
- Do carry umbrella in case you are walking from parking spot.
- There is a form outside hospital which need to be filled as per your slot. You will be called inside based on token number on the form.
- On the form give only co-win registered mobile number & appointment ref number as reg. Number.
- While doing payment inside, can avoid delays if you carry cash. (Sometimes delay in card payment)
- Sitting arrangement is provided outside as well as inside.
- Make sure to have sufficient water before taking vaccine.
- After vaccination, as guided, sit there for atleast 30 mins before you leave. "
5 stars,Got my first dose of covid vaccine today from symbiosis university hospital. The whole procedure was very well coordinated and the staff was also very helpful.  kudos to the staff for  managing everything smoothly.  i just had a doubt that on arogya setu app the charges are showing 780rs but here i paid 850rs excluding the medicinal charges.  Other than that everything was very well conducted. The campus area is awesome. 
4 stars,"Vaccine Experience : Symbiosis University Hospital [Age bracket: 18-44] [Covishield]

Had asked a friend who was tracking the availability of the slots regularly, to book a slot for me since I was unable to book one through Cowin since the start of May.

He was able to book it on 22nd May, 12-4.30pm slot. Got to know about the booking around 1PM on the same day itself.

Called the hospital and asked about the availability and if I'll be able to get one and I was told that there is huge crowd but you'll get the vaccine, just reach the center around 4.30PM (Reason to call beforehand- I had to follow through a different center for 4 days for my Dads vaccine (Senior citizen); for 3 days they couldn't administer it because the stock used to get over irrespective of the booking.)

Reached the center around 4.30PM, had to wait for the token till 5.30PM. Till that time they were calling mourning slot people, afternoon slot queue started after they finished all the morning appointments. My token number was 1500+, had around 500 ppl before me.

Finally got my token number called out to stand in the queue around 9PM. Then you enter the big AC lobby. Separate queues are formed for each counter & staff makes sure social distancing is maintained. There are around 8 counters to enter, verify the applicant's data and process the fee(850 bucks). Cash/Card/UPI payment is accepted. There are 2 Axis ATM machines inside the lobby. This step takes much longer than needed, abit much less time compared to waiting but still 5-10 minutes to process the data and payments for each applicant. Completed the payment & got the jab around 9.30PM. After this you'll be asked to wait for 30 minutes in the observation area, they'll give you hard copy of the certificate in the meantime. Purchased Hospital recommended Crocin and Pan D from the OPD store for 43 bucks and left the center around 10.30PM.

Observation and recommendations -

Center is located in the outskirts of Pune, in Lavale. University campus is huge and beautiful and I'd recommend once you get the token, leave the crowded area and chill around the campus or in your car. Educated illiterates can't follow simple social distancing despite of repeated announcements by the hospital staff. Outside area have decent seating capacity but obviously not enough for 1000+ people who had the appointment that day.

I used N95 mask and tried to stay as far from the crowd as possible. Had put on the face shield once I was called to stand in the queue. Token announcement on the speaker is quite loud and you don't need to be around main area to hear it. You can explore the campus in the meantime which I did!

Overall the center is clean, well managed (for couple of hundred appointments, if you're gonna call thousands of ppl there'll be bad experience for sure) and have a lot of parking space. They can improve upon the payment system to lower the processing time though.

Happy Vaccination peeps! "
5 stars,"I had visited for Vaccination on 26th May. The process was extremely smooth. Enough guards to direct you to parking space, VAN available to pick people from parking and drop to hospital, slip cum token allocation was smooth where you had to fill the details and wait for your token sequence to be called.

Overall, it took me 2 Hrs for the complete process. I had booked an appointment for 9 AM.

Admins also arranged for campus tour following social distancing norms for people, who had slots after a gap. It was optional. I went on the tour and found the campus to be huge and beautiful. Overall, well managed center. "
5 stars,"Was worried when I read bad reviews for the first two days but I can say that this center's management has learnt pretty fast.

Excellent management for vaccination. Booked 9-10 slot for 24th and reached here by 8.45am. They allowed vehicles only for the first slot when we came in. So no unnecessary crowd. Excellent seating arrangements with frequent announcements of procedure. Crowd is managed with a token system and they have 8 counters for vaccination. Procedure was smooth and safe and vaccination was done by 10am.

Would recommend to book this institute for vaccination as this is very well managed and pretty safe. On top of this the drive and scenary is awesome. "

5 stars,"I got admitted to a hospital after roughly about 24 years, thanks to Covid 19 that chased me. I had know that this hospital is new and also has good facilities, this time I happened to experience it first hand.
They have a separate Covid 19 section. First 3 days I was admitted to the economy bed section, which was surprisingly clean, spacious and top notch with all required equipment for each bed.
I was wondering how would the twin sharing or private rooms would be.
After 3 days when the twin sharing room was empty, I was shifted there and I was impressed with the infrastructure. After spending 7 days in the twin sharing room I was super impressed with the service of the nurses, housekeeping, canteen and even visiting doctors. Very courteous in nature and genuinely helpful. "
5 stars,"One of the best hospitals.
Doctors gave us proper treatment and saved us from critical medical conditions during COVID.
Staff is very cooperative. They took care of us very well. Thank you! "
2 stars,"It seems that the doctors are never available. Receptionist would call and confirm the timing for appointment yet if you reach on time you will not find the doctor. Keep waiting and waiting and then if you request them to refund they will do the process but would put a remark that patient is not willing to wait.

If the hospital has confirmed appointment time yet the doctor is unavailable somehow it is patient‚Äôs fault. Before the admin actually asks or writes anything. Kindly search by the same name i am posting review and figure out the matter. To rest patient expect this kind of incident. Since this is the second time this is happening with me. "
1 star,"I visited this hospital regarding back pain. I arrived at 8:40 AM ant it took around 11:30 am . Around 4 hrs wasted. I need to do MRI and then they told me outside dr prescription will not consider for further treatment so i had appointment with one ortho dr Vilas sir (Dr Bharati sharma OPD) And he least interested to saw my earlier reports and also medicine. I already did X-ray and blood test also some medicines regarding muscle relaxation. And dr written same medicines again I told him already I had this medicine in past. But he ignored and also he is very arrogant. I think if time is important for you then please don't visit this hospital otherwise you will get very bad experience here.

I request this hospital to suggest drs and ask them to review previous reports and prescriptions and do further treatment. Not again start same treatment.

I am struggling with back pain from last one year badly. "
1 star,"This review only for doctors behavior especially Dr. Aditi Pandey ( Nephrology OPD). She is very rude, ungenerous, and manner less doctor. Her behavior is very bad. She is very arrogant person. Need to improve behavioural manners..... Symboisis hospitals atmosphere is very good. Cleaning staff. Nurses are very very good. Management is very nice.But doctor is very egoistic. My experience is very bad. "
4 stars,OPD of Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Center. Well equipped. 
1 star,Took my husband with head injury to symbiosis emergency as it was the closest option. He had to wait for 4hours before getting a CT scan done. And another 2 hours to get the report. The precious initial time of 6hrs was waisted. And then..after 6hrs I was told the ct brain and ct spine have come out to be normal. And surprisingly.. 2 days later again I got my husband tested for extreme pain. And now.. He was diagnosed with a fracture in cervical spine. Which symbiosis doctors failed to notice even on a CTscan. Very shameful

4 stars,"This hospital exists inside a black hole. Once inside, time dies, while in the outside world the time moves at it's pace.

Rest is all good. Every city in India should have a Hospital facility like Symbiosis. "
5 stars,"University is located in mountain.
Nice scenery around the campus.

Facilities provided by the hospital is quite good.

We visited here to COVID treatment.

All the staff members are very good.

Doctor are really nice & take care of patients.

Medicine facilities & treatment cost is less but good.

Parking facility & security is also good "
3 stars,"This is a nice center to get your first COVID jab. They give you only COVID Shield jab and maybe in future they may start with other vaccine brands. The whole process was very smooth from start to finish and it took me around 10 minutes starting from registration to getting the jab on your left arm. Then you are directed to a comfortable observation seating area. The center is very big and very hygienic. But, I was disappointed by the rude young security guy at the main entrance door of the hospital (needs proper training on how to be more friendly with people coming from a 45 minutes drive home from Pune city to get their jab). They do have a ATM at the ground floor. The cafeteria is hard to locate and I did not see any food over there. There was a sandwich stall outside the building but I don‚Äôt know if it was fresh or not! If you want to enjoy a long distance drive and go around the hills to get your first vaccine jab, then it‚Äôs worth coming here. Rest all good! "
5 stars,Visited for 1 dose of Covishield. Had a great experience. Staff is very supportive. They managed vaccine drive very well. 
5 stars,One of the best medical campuses in Maharahstra and potential of being one of the best in whole of india. Best experience w.r.t covid vaccination drive. 
1 star,"Our most recent and the worst experience, on the first day, the doctor checked the report and said that the operation will be done here, come in the next week we will fix the date of the operation. So we wait for one week. When we go in the next week, they said that the operation will not be done here, do it elsewhere. "
4 stars,"Nice experience, wll recommend for covid vaccination. Good facilities helpful staff at every stage. "
3 stars,"Came here for covid vaccination Saturday morning. I expected a delay but not this much. Staff is helpful and they do make people do some engaging activities which is good. But hey! We're not here for that. Overall delay was the problem. Some of the tips -
1. Carry the cash as sometimes there is delay in online payments
2. Try and book early slot - I was booked for 10-11am but even at 11.20am they were not done with half of 10-11am slot people.
3. Or may be come in the last slot post lunch to avoid the morning chaos. They do not close until last person for the day is vaccinated. "
5 stars,"Well organized vaccination drive. Kudos to the Symbiosis team for such good management. The process is very seamless. You just need to take your identity card and appointment slip, and everything is taken care.
There are many volunteers who guide you in the process. All the social norms are followed at every step. "
5 stars,Thank you for your service and support. I would like to thank each and every staff of general hospital OPD. They are very supportive and very nice management. 
1 star,"Lack of practical knowledge...
Need to improve behavioural manners...
No time importance...

I don't suggest to ge there for any treatment, as they do trial and error on petient due to lack of clarity of disease. Doctors are not likely to speak to get complete history before going ahead for treatment. "
5 stars,Great and huge campus. Very well maintained. The location is quite scenic too. 
5 stars,""" On the date of 14/02/2023 Registered my mother opd card after examine by Dr. Yash Khanwilkar Sir & send to ICU Dept. due to Loss of Appetite & Low BP, treatment is started immediately.

1 star,"My review is based on my experience for the COVID vaccination on 22-05-2020.

My slot was between 11am - 12pm. I reached the hospital at 10:30 and as soon as I reached the entrance, I was asked to park outside the Campus. That means walking all the way inside from the turning outside the gate. Considering how huge the Campus is, I was surprised to see all the open parking places inside the campus and they still did not allow people to park inside after a certain time. What if someone has problems to walk/ any side effects after the vaccination slot ?

As soon as I reached, I was surprised to see a 1 KM line inside from the hospital entrance all the way to the backside of the hospital. There was no proper information about why people were in line or what was happening with the vaccination. Total Mismanagement. At 11:05 we were informed that 9-10am slot vaccinations are still happening. That meant that after 9-10, 10-11 would begin. Someone told us to collect the forms from the gate and there was no point standing in line. Everyone left the line and rushed to collect the forms. Forms were distributed only to 10-11, so again we had to wait there without any proper information.

I left the campus to go home for lunch considering I was in the 11-12 slot, but my friend who was there for 10-11 informed me that he was in line. I reached at almost 2:30 and was surprised to see that 10-11 slots were still being given. He was still in Line.

Finally at 4:30 there was some proper management and they started calling people as per token system for 11-12 slots. My slot came at 6:30 almost 6 hours after the scheduled slot. I reached home at 7:30 PM
So disappointing considering it was Symbiosis.

Apparently, there were 4500 slots dedicated for vaccination and only 5 counters to process everyone. No proper management, people having to wait without food. No Social Distancing. Only Disappointment. I'm surprised they were allowed to process so many slots. They could have had 2/3 centers across the campus to process so many people They could have had sign boards to explain everything. It's unfair to the people and to the staff. Also, considering we are paying Rs. 850 now, I'm sure Crocin could have been given for free atleast. Other centers are ensuring people leave in less than 3 hours max.

I'd advice to wait for some other slots rather than go here for the vaccination. Request the GOM to ensure that such vaccination centers are looked into. No need to slot so many people together please. What if someone in the 4000  people present would have been positive for Covid "
5 stars,The hospital is very clean and the Hospital staff and doctors are very good. Here I had no idea I was a covid-19 patient. I am thankful to all the staff and doctors in the hospital 
5 stars,"Please be there on the time mentioned in the appointment sheet it‚Äôs under the preferred time slot, I reached at 9 am whereas my preferred time was between 12-4:30 pm. Very well managed no queuing reach the security lady in the counter she would give you a pink form to be filled, fill in your reg no( number received in SMS), ID number (Pan , Adhar etc) , your Name , address. Pen provided but it‚Äôs always good to carry your own, the form stays with you and there is a token number written manually on the top right which when announced you know it‚Äôs your turn and then you need to proceed inside till then sit back relax and enjoy the weather and the relaxing yoga provided by the executive there on the spot!

The moment you enter show your appointment details, Photo ID and payment INR 850 carry change saves time ! Get the receipt head towards the OPD get the jab and submit the receipt to lady at the desk for your certificate (printed copy provided on the spot) and also you get the electronic copy updated in the COwin profile after few minutes,  medicines after the dose is option available on payment. You are required to wait for 30 mins in the observation area and thereafter you are free to go and yeah don‚Äôt forget to get clicked !!!!! Jab done right say cheezzzz!!! "

1 star,"I went to hospital with my mother treatment, Doctor treated us like government hospital, Doctor didn't communicate with properly.
orthopedict doctor giving my mother wrong tratement and communication was very rudly.
This Hospital services are extremely slow, general OPD being free for patients their hospital staff thinks they are doing favour to patients  also keep them unnecessarily waiting for long periods.
Staff and orthopedict doctor  speaks rudely to patients and does not follow confidentiality of patients conditions which is embarrassing. "

4 stars,Great campus...with good facilities 
1 star,"Worst crowd management and miss communication.

This is first hand cousin experience.

There was Zero social distancing, see photos attached. Imagine 2000 people waiting in sun clueless just to get a chance to be called upon for their turn. Only 3-4 people managing the crowd.

They had opened 2000 slots on their Day1 Saturday 22 May 2021. Unfortunately token system was FCFS basis so no point in having a specific slot. People having booking for 12pm came early morning and got ahead in queue. We were waiting till 8 HOURS till evening but did not get the vaccine. Will not prefer this center again. There were people who came walk-in (without cowin booking) and were given tokens too, Spoke to them personally.

Moreover, parking was outside the campus and had to walk alot upto vaccination site. The campus is really big. Overall this was a nightmare experience for us wasted whole day with risk of getting infected.

Hope they learn and improve for better parking, crowd, sitting arrangements and slot token management system. "
1 star,"Worst experience of vaccination today.
Had to wait almost 3 hours for vaccination.
Administration told this was due to confussion in cowin portal.

5 stars,Me and my wife have taken vaccination today here and it was really great experience. They have placed volunteer at every place starting from gate to parking till you exit out of campus. Whole process was very smooth. We reached just 10 minutes before our 12-4 pm slot and our token number was 125-126 so it took approximate 45 minutes to get jab done. And then 30 minutes of waiting periods. Really Appreciate all the effort taken by management to ensure such a experience.

2 stars,"Only the building is good and clean, the rest of the staff are very arrogant and do not talk well with patients.  Also the doctor is not giving proper advice. Last week I had an operation, the doctor had seen the report, without looking properly or knowing that it was not a minor operation, he did the operation and then told me that the minor operation will not take place in the theatre, and sent me home with stitches.  No advice was given, no regimen was given. Two days ago, the doctor did not ask for the stitches, but then he said, the tumor will go away by itself, then I did not know why the operation was needed.

1. Total lack of signage for the location of Vax on internal roads. Please put prominent and different format signs for directions
2. Must advise that  certificate of 1st dose is required soft or hard copy. Not everyone may have ability to download it last minute
2. Only cotton swab was provided to cover the injected area,  a small piece of tape must also be put over the cotton swab to hold it in place "

2 stars,"Massive Hospital like a 5 star hotel, but pathetic food, pathetic staff, pathetic nurse‚Äôs except for one or two Doctors are not experienced and visits are just once in a day that too attitude is like they are doing us a favour. No facility of normal needs of a patients  no fruits no coconut juice no auto no taxi for anything and everything you have to go to sus village three KM and you do not get any auto or taxi I would recommend NEVER to be admitted to this hospital "
1 star,"Government given land for hospital but ,symbiosis taking parking charges from patients. WHY? "
5 stars,"Nice experience at the Symbiosis Hospital Lavale for my 1st dose vaccination . Walk - Ins okay ( please call ahead before going and check exact hours ) . Saw the Symbiosis Hospital campus & medical college for the first time . Quite impressive setup.

Last Monday, I got the vaccination done in this hospital.The hospital staff is very cooperative at the vaccination center.If we need Aadhar card or PAN card at the vaccination center then we have to carry it along with us.
The cost of the vaccine is ‚Çπ780.Take ‚Çπ59 for pill medicine.

After taking the vaccine, they also give you a certificate and tell you all the details when you have to come next time?

UPI,Cash, google pay. Phone pay Can you deposit money on any of these?
After taking the vaccine, there is a rest for 20:25 minutes.

Vaccines are given in the shoulder, so it is better if you wear clothes that are loose fitting.

The vaccination time is from morning to evening. "
5 stars,"I been to this hospital for COVID vaccination of my parents. Hospital premise is very clean and desciplined. Staff is very supportive and prompt. Good facility and easy process of handling vaccination and registration, especially for senior citizens. Waiting room are clean and following all COVID norms of social distancing and sanitisation. Would recommend it to others for safe places to take vaccination in future. They have both vaccines in stock. "
5 stars,"26th May 2021, Covishield first dose vaccination experience:

I'd booked a 10am-11am slot for first dose of Covishield at this hospital. I reached at 9am, the centre was not crowded. They had made superb arrangements. The process was streamlined, and they had a good amount of staff available who would help you throughout the process. I had to fill a small form which took 5 minutes, and then waited about another 10 minutes till my token was called. Payment took another 5 minutes. I was able to get the vaccine within 20 minutes of arriving at the centre.

Be sure to wear a t-shirt, or something that can expose your sleeves easily. If you wear a shirt like me, you'll have to remove shirt to take vaccine.

Overall, it was a great experience and very well managed. I would advise to reach earlier if possible. "
5 stars,"I'm hospitalized for Covid treatment. I'm getting best treatment. Doctors team is continuously monitoring  and in touch with all the patients. Support staff is very courteous and cooperative. Food quality, Rooms, hygiene maintenance is just awesome. Location of hospital is in outskirts but pollution free which helps to get recover fast. I don't think, so called famous hospitals in Pune City would able to give such royal treatment in this pandemic situation. But SUHRC is doing more than best. Many thanks to SUHRC and team. "
5 stars,Went here for vaccination in May end. The place was very well managed. Refreshments were available for people. Adequate social distancing was maintained. Ample free parking space available in the campus. It took us about just an hour and half to compete the whole process. 
5 stars,The vaccination drive is very well coordinated. They have volunteers at every step to guide you through. Good and enough sitting arrangement for people. They keep announcing whatever is happening. They also ensure your time is not wasted!

5 stars,"I took my vaccine shot on 22nd May, The hospital was prepared for 1,500 people, since one night prior gov kept slot open for all nearly 5,000 people showed up.  The hospital management very really patient and tried their best to make system smooth,  even though many people were shouting and asking same questions multiple times, the staff were really polite and give best possible answers.

As I entered inside ""Vikrant Jadhav"" he is managing the admin work really helped and guide me throughout the process really well,  He showed great professionalism and made sure I did not face any challenges throughout the process.

Great Staff and Great Work !!!! "

5 stars,"I went to this hospital for Vaccination and here the process was very very much systematic and all the staff was very cooperative and helpful
Process:- 1st i had to show the message for the slot and id proof then they gave me a pink form to fill, after that i had to go in and they gave me pad and pen to fill that form(offcourse you have to return it). In 5-10 min my token no. was announced and after that i had to go for payment after that with in 5 min my vaccination was done.
Make sure you carry cash change as it will save your time.all options of payment are available but if you want to do it fast, carry the cash with exact amount.Its only the payment process which takes little time. Snacks are available inside the center if you want to have, please carry water bottle.
Please check if you have the message or PDF of the appointment schedule. Carry your id proof. "

5 stars,"Excellent Covid Vaccination Setup. Would like to compliment the management and Veteran Gopi Iyer's team for setting up an extremely smooth and seamless facility for 1200 vaccination a day in such a short time. Right from entry into gate, there are guards who direct you all the way to your allotted location depending on batch timing. There is plenty of directed parking too at a short distance (would recommend a driver if available so you can get off right at the vaccination site). At the registration counter token number is given on a 1st come 1st serve basis. The is plenty of SAFE seating, walking area, refreshments available while your number is called out. After this - Plenty of payment counters and Jabs happen almost instantaneously with 6 nurses. While you wait for mandatory 30min to check for any reactions, you even get you Vaccination certificate and can buy Meds right there. Great job team Symbi - Keep up the good work. Proper instructions and what too expect are also shared along the way by very helpful staff like Venkat & the entire team. "
5 stars,"Visited on 2nd June. Best arrangement for Vaccination. Everything is managed good. Parking, volunteers to guide, token system, social distancing while waiting. Had went for 12 pm slot. Reached at arround 12 and got vaccine in approx 1 hour. Another 30 min had to wait. They have got medicines, drinking water and snaks. Whole process for token and vaccine took less than 2 hours. Came out of campus in less than 2 hours. "
5 stars,"Very well organised. There are snacks if you need, it‚Äôs clean, staff is wonderful. There is a separate staff to guide and handle the crowd. The drive to the hospital is wonderful. There is shuttle service from parking to the reception. The parking is about 500mts walk from the reception. Please consider taking your umbrellas. They did 140 appointments in 1 hour. They will be open until 4pm today. But I have seen slots until 7pm on other days. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you come late, they will give you the dose of you have appointment for the day. The campus is huge. If you have kids you can get them also, they can play around under supervision until you get your shot done. It took 35 mins after my token number was announced including wait time after the dose. "
5 stars,"All services are excellent. I admitted in 251 ward. Here in this ward all nurses are so approchable, they gave timely care. Their sincerity towards patient is highly appreciable. But you increase the number of toilets because for 30 patients you provide only two. Remaining all is excellent. "
