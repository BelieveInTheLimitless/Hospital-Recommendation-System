1 star,Had to give one star since there is no minus rating this hospital does not deserve even 1 star and it's the worst hospital in kondhwa were their staff lack basic knowledge and understanding and pretty good at messing things up! 
1 star,"Had very bad experience. My father had chest  pain and in emergency we rushed to this unprofessional hospital. They asked to admit and we agreed  on that after one day they told we need to do 2d eco, so i asked when they will do, they told after next 2 day and they have discharged my dad and asked me to pay 2d eco charges in same bill to confirm dr. Appointment and i paid but next 5 days they didnt give me appointment and when i panic due to thire unprofessional behaviour of staff, they are behaving  very bad (dr. Hafiz). Next one week my dad waiting  for full diagnose for proper treatment. Full waste money. Think before going to such bad hospital. They cant manage the things. "
