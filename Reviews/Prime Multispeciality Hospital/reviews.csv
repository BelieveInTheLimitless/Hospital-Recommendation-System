5 stars,"Went here for my booster dose of Covid vaccination the other day and sister Charu administered the same most efficiently.  Have never taken an intramuscular injection that hurt so less. Really, our healthcare system would collapse in a day if it wasn't for such efficient and hardworking nursing staff!! Also the duty doctor n the people at the reception were most helpful and courteous making the experience of the visit much better 😀 👍- Dr. Meherzad Boomla "
1 star,"I went here to get the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on December 11, 2022, and my experience was horrible. First, the nursing staff overcharged for the vaccine and provided no receipt. Second, they did not record that the vaccine had been administered, as a result of which, the certificate on CoWIN portal was not generated even two weeks later. Thirdly, when I went to enquire about the certificate, the nurse blatantly lied that she had not administered the vaccine and instead of taking action, Dr. Kunal Oswal defended her saying she was new.
Ultimately, the certificate was generated, but such poor service and lack of management does not translate into healthcare. "
5 stars,"Parasmani hospital is very good. My child has hand fracture i come here and admitted.Doctors,nurses and support staff is very good and they care a lot about patients. I recommend this for every one. "
5 stars,The services that I receive from paarasmani hospital is excellent. Dr. Kunal oswal and the staff are friendly and ensure that I am properly informed about my health and care. I would have no qualms in recommending them to friendly and friends. 
5 stars,"I was at this facility to take my second COVAXIN. From appointment to vaccination it was a very smooth process and the staff was knowledgeable, helpful and caring. Facility was very clean and organized. "
5 stars,"I have recently had a stay at PARASMANI Hospital, Hadapsar,Pune – a new experience for me. I am very thankful for the dedicated professional and hard-working staff at the hospital.
I watched the cleaners working hard to keep the wards clean and free from infections .
Dr Kunal Oswal and his team of doctors are highly experienced and professional.The hospital specializes in various kinds of surgeries.
Had a fantastic feel at home experience recently when I was admitted at his PARASMANI Hospital 😊🙏 .I thank Dr Oswal sir and his staff from all my heart for doing this exemplary service to the human race, God bless you all 😇 "
2 stars,"Good setup and clean. However not a great experience on vaccination. Bureaucracy at its core on not wanting to enter data on cowin. Said that they will only enter data at the end of the day. This leads to errors and issues for people but they were least bothered. After a lot of request they agreed and it literally took 30 seconds for the person who was otherwise sitting idle.

Sad to see that they will choose to sit idle and let data entry work pile up, but not do it as people get vaccinated. Didn't expect this from an otherwise good setup. "

1 star,"Irresponsible & poor management.
Went there for taking covid booster shot. I was shocked to see that the receptionist guy only took the injection. After payment he directed me to doctor's room and asked me to unbutton the shirt & show upper arm. I was shocked & surprised to notice that the receptionist was administering the injection. By the time I said not to take, he gave the injection. Vaccination status is not yet updated in my Arogyasetu app. I am really afraid after taking shot from such unqualified persons.

As a reply to hospital's comment -
<<<<<<< HEAD
I got the vaccination certificate but many days after my injection. If you look at the comments, you can see there are many who faced similar delay. I would request hospital management to fix the server at the earliest. If the receptionist is a qualified GNM, then why was he not in uniform? Also in my  vaccination certificate, a different perosn's name is given against the person who administered the injection. why is it so? "
5 stars,Hospital is too good.Dr and all staff is very kind and co-operative.. 
1 star,"Pathetic service and totally unorganized set of
People. Mistake to be there for the vaccination. After request also, invoice for payment for vaccine not issued. To recognize who has paid or not , they will stamp on your hand “Paid”.  Doctor present said that she will issue the invoice next day as there are too many people and they were not ready to handle. In short, go for some other place as such places may be risk for getting the right vaccine amid all chaos. I had specifically ensured to ask to see/check the bottle of vaccine with expiry date and you should do so while at this place. "
5 stars,Had a great experience taking covishild booster for my wife. Clinic is clean and well maintained. It has also has proper waiting space. 
5 stars,Very polite and helping staff. Neat & clean place.

5 stars,"We visited this hospital for Covishield vaccination. Staff were friendly, cooperative and very helpful. It was a great experience and would recommend all to visit this hospital for Covid vaccination or for other relevant requirement as appropriate. Great experience overall. "
5 stars,I have taken covishild vaccine booster dose at Parasmani hospital along with my wife and mother. The arrangement of giving token and registration is very smooth. Hospital staff is very supportive and helpful. 
5 stars,Service was really nice and booster doses are also available here 
1 star,"Pathetic staff. You take Booster dose for which there is no rush at all and these folks take their sweet time to send the data on Cowin app. So you would have taken the dose but officially it would still not show up.

Avoid these Chors "
5 stars,"Did my son's (14+ yrs) covid vaccination today at Parasmani Hospital.  Very friendly staff. My son was too scared to take the vaccine. Mr Harshavardhan administered the vaccine, and my son didn't feel it at all. Thanks to the Mr Harshavardhan and staff of Parasmani Hospital. "
