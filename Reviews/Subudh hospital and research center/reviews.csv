1 star,"Doctors are good and cleanliness also somewhat good.

But quality of staff management is worst to worts I have ever seen. Behavior is rude. Seems like all are newly hired. Way of coordinating with patients is horrible. They don't even know how to operate the advance medicals devices. Really need to improve. "
1 star,Extremely poor management. Slow staff. Looks like the hospital or its facilities haven't been upgraded for many years. The basement floor is ridden with mosquitos. Was there for the vaccine and it was very poorly managed. Made us wait for ‚Ä¶  More
5 stars,"Overall excellent experience for vaccination. Place is clean, waiting area is spacious. Service is good. They cater to small numbers daily. The downside is they do vaccination in batches of 10 (to avoid wastage of vaccine). So if a batch of ten persons is not present, they have to go back and come again next day. As everywhere appointment has no advantage. Token system on first come basis is used. "
1 star,"I really want to give  minus 5 stars but google doesn't allow it so can't.

Staff is  very rude. Don't have cleanliness we expect in hospital . There are mosquitoes everywhere. We were there for  the vaccine but staff couldn't give us any proper answer.  They said to wait for 1. 5 hrs  then doctor will cone and then they will decide if they can give vaccine or not.

Rescheduling my vaccine appointment to different center is the best decision I have taken today,  we couldn't bear to stand it there for even 15 minutes.

I really hope they treat admitted patients better  and upper level of hospital are much cleaner  and in good condition than ground floor, because if not then really  they need to change management or close the  hospital. "
5 stars,"I had an awesome experience for Covid vaccination of my parents here. Very nice staff and well maintained clean hospital.
Well managed (only registered users allowed for vaccination) vaccination process. Ample space for waiting outside of hospital to avoid crowd inside.
Thank you and keep it up üëç "
