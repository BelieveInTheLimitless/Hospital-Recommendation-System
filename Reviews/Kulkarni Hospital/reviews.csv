5 stars,"Very nice and a fully equipped hospital , Dr Kulkarni owns this hospital and is mostly available all the times .
Being a very good doctor , there is always waiting at this hospital , the doctor and the staff are very courteous and offer good support to their patients .
Finding a parking for car is impossible and for that you might have to drive atleast 1 km away from the clinic . Find a parking for 2 wheeler  is also difficult .
I strongly feel that such an efficient hospital should shift to a better place . "
