1 star,"ðŸ˜¡Worst Hospital ever visited, greedy peopleðŸ’¸ðŸ’µðŸ’°, They only need a person with insurance.
cockroaches are scrolling everywhere in the hospitalðŸ˜ž.
The staff was creating too much noise at night speaking on the phoneðŸ“±ðŸ˜ž.
They stole my phone charger as well.
Don't visit this hospital ever ðŸ˜¡. "
