5 stars,"I went for my father Hernia surgery and  my experience was incredible like the way they have supported and suggested me at each and every stage.

Staffs are very humble and they are helping the patient in every step. Hospital is also pocket friendly so no need to worry about the changes.

Specially Mohammad sir and Fahim sir helped me a lot though out the complete process.

5 stars,"My name is Farida Borge, 68 years, last week visited Dr Shaikh with congestion,  was detected with pneumonia.  Within 5 days of Opd treatment  at his Care Hospital, my infection is under control. Alhumdullilah.
Dr. SHAIKH really takes very good care and the staff is also cooperative.

I have known Dr Shaikh for last 8 years, and been treated by him for several ailments, always successfully.  May ALLAH SWT bless him for his noble work.🌹

5 stars,"I have been an old patient of Dr.Mohammed Shaikh. His work in treating his patients is unbiased, professional and works wonders.
Patients go to him for the first time, because of reviews from friends and family, but once they experience healing from his medicines and treatments, those first time patients become his regular patients.
The staff at care hospital is friendly, helpful with assistance and have a calm composure.
I would definitely recommend this doctor for everyone. His hands have 'shifa' - healing in them.

5 stars,"Hello this is Afifa here .
I for one has a weak immunity system and is prone to diseases and infections quickly, so again I was found positive with  acute dengue fever And a stomach which couldn't retain anything from the past 4 days due to vomiting.
I am from Uttar Pradesh and was in pune for my vacations. We didn't know the city well but it was like a miracle from above that we were able to find this ""care hospital"".
Believe me when I say that a patient gets better by good environment, cheerful behavior and less by medications.
My weakness, nausena, pain etc went away in one day like it was never there.
The treatment which I received there was far superior than in any  of the hospitals there coz the infrastructure and the name doesn't give relief but the genuine smile and simple act of kindness does.
I can assure u that i for one didn't feel like for a second that I was in a hospital and i can assure you that neither will you.
If we get down to their hygiene, respect love, care, duty then I'm afraid I have to write 6-7 paragraphs more coz it was more that.
I feel genuinely happy and blessed to have visited and stayed in this hospital.
