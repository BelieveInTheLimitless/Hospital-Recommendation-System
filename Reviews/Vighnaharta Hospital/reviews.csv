4 stars,"I went here for consultation for my cough.
The waiting period was about 15-20 mins.
The receptionist will take in your O2 level, BP measurement and weight. The doctor asked me for my symptoms, examined me and prescribed me with the required medication.
It is a nice small hospital.
The consultation fees was 150 Rs.
They have a dispensary right next to the hospital for access and you can find all prescribed medicines there.
In all it was a decent experience. "
1 star,Hospital it not good. Even Dr. Doesnâ€™t have knowledge how to treat patients simply they admit the patient and looting journey start. Went there in Sep months for cough directly they side get admitted if have health policy. Actually as per health policy they patient admission was required and rejected my claim due to hospital mistake I loosed my hard earned money. 
1 star,"Very bad service, Doctor Doesn't have knowledge how to behave and also they charge big amount for simply check up. charges are hidden and they don't tell you whats going on. So please don't visit here. Very bad experience. For simply check up they took 500rs for cost. And Dr. Nalwade asked for FHPL policy. So look like they are just money seekers. They not care about you...! Bad...!  0star from my side...! "
