1 star,"Not Happy with the service , really disappointed ☹️
They don't have proper equipments like stretcher etc. They call walkin person to hospital to move the patient. staff also don't havemanagement

They always commit for normal delivery but at the end they prefer c section surgery  . worst hospital, unhygienic place not recommended in covid situation.
No safety precautions , Dr.kamate don't have manners how to talk with the patient .no prescription after discharge, no billing documents .

Never recommended such worst place . "
5 stars,"Easy access. Friendly doctor.
Gynaecologist on call. "
