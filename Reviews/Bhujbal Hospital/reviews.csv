1 star,"Dr. Abhilash sharing lie information to patients family. Not the experience doctor. And not co-operating at all. He is scaring to patients family and showing wrong direction of the process. He's accountant pavan, doesn't know the things about the patients and following his doctor to telling lie information. Not recommended to anyone to go in this hospital. "
