1 star,Ghanta Royal. I went to this hospital for my wife treatment. I was telling receptionist about the issue but she doesn't listening to me and roaming around. Don't visit such hospital ever who don't care about their patients. 
5 stars,"Excellent doctors with good diagnosis.
Both Dr Sulakshana and Dr Nilesh are very fine surgeons and cooperative doctors.

Every child in our family is born at Royal Hospital.

We all love you
And want to thank you both.

4 stars,"Hospitals are the health care institution that provides patient treatment with specialized equipment and methodical staff. Have you ever been confused by reading the title or name of a hospital? Like sometimes there’s a charitable hospital, and wonder why they are different than our government or private hospitals. Everything depends upon how it works or how was it formed.

The most common ones are general hospital, which even have emergency department. A major health facility in a region, like district hospitals, have large number of beds for intensive unit care and long-term medical care. There are specialized hospitals that provide certain treatment such as trauma centres, children’s hospital, senior’s or geriatric hospital, rehabilitation hospital and some hospitals are offer specific medical treatment like psychiatric help (psychiatric hospitals) and other disease types. Specialized hospitals reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals as they are equipped for specific or categorical disease. "
