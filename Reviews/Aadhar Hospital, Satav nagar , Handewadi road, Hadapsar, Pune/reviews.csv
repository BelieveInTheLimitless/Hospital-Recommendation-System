1 star,Worst hospital..my brother met an accident at 12 in night.. Since it was raining his wounds was not clearly visible..but Dr without check told to take him to another hospital we will not take him.... They don't even bother to check...luckly we got another hospital and after taking treatment we came back to that hospital for asking why they have not checked him.... They could not recognize him and said that patient was very serious and required ventilator.... There license should be cancelled as they really are not for emergency situation. 
1 star,"Very poor experience post care after delivery. In case of emergency also no special attention is received by doctor. The patient had cold and fever with sever pain in abdomen and got admit into hospital but no attention is given by doctor more than an hour. So finally we decide to shift to some other hospital.
Very painful experience. üò£ "
1 star,"Pathetic service by Nurse Madhavi no covid norms followed no mask on using of sanitizer  when requested  to use mask the staff started to raise voice and I quote her ""what you will do if i don't use mask don't teach me im a nurse im wearing mask since morning do whatever you can"" it was 11.35pm 28th September 2021 and it was an emergency as my brother had a very bad wound and had to be treated immediately but the rude behavior of the hospital Nurse made me leave that hospital and had to take my brother to Jahengir hospital where he had been treated will by following all the covid norms. I will dis recommend this hospital, I didn't even feel like giving 1 star. The worst Nurse I have ever seen in my life and I even don't think that she was a qualified nurse. "
5 stars,"Had very nice experience here in Aadhar Hospital. My mother was admitted due to covid and the doctors over there Dr. Sawant, Dr. Pukhe and Dr. Atul Chopra treated her very well and ultimately she recovered and came back home. Thanks to them.

2 stars,"I went to this hospital because of boiling water on my daughter's leg.
He was told to be admitted for two days. And a lot of injection.
All over 100.
The doctor at casualty told me to buy the medicines that need to be stored in the fridge for 4 days.
I asked how much it would cost because I had less money.
4 times more than the outside hospital for dressing
I almost got idea,when the doctor told me there is plastic surgery after treatment. I understand that he
Will get me admission in orphanage. I told to doctor,  enough this pain killer,  now am moving to another hospital,

And I shifted to another small clinic.

The doctor saw the slip on Aadhaar hospital and shocked. Only 3-4%  burns.
100 / - doctor's fee, 280 / medicines -
she is fine now. "
1 star,"The worst scammer I've ever seen. I totally lost faith on doctors. The first incident was when I went to the hospital for skin treatment. My leg was burnt by hot water. He saw the skin and told that we will not be able operate this redirected to other hospital but since they will lose 1 customer they insisted to sit there and wrote some medicine and charged me 500 just for redirecting to other hospital which he searched on Google. Another incident when my mom's wrist got twisted. He insisted to have operation and for time being he applied temporary plaster. And charged ‚Çπ3000 for it. ‚Çπ3000 for a temporary plaster was quite surprising to me. So I asked for the bill, for which he made many excuses like get the medical bill I'll show in this bill only, come tomorrow I'll give you full bill. And after arguing for 15mins, He gave bill for ‚Çπ2000 only. And asked to come tomorrow for second bill. Another very strange incident was yesterday only when I went there to do RTPCR test, they said it will ‚Çπ950 and You pay me online to my number and I'll send the report on whatsapp without even conducting the test. And when I said NO the receptionist started convincing me. "

1 star,"Expensive hospital and poor service. (Base Hospital, Hadapsar, Pune)

I admitted my father for observation only for 1 night (12 hours) as we thought it would be risky to keep him at home. If they require emergency treatment.
Next day morning we made appointment in other hospitals.
Since they don't have ICU facilities, we kept them in a normal room.
They charged us for just one night, for a normal room,
10,000 r + 1400 blood test + medicines and sal in we had to buy separately.

bad services
In oxygen supply equipment, there is a water source that contains distilled
should be used but the nurse added water from my drinking water bottle which I found inappropriate.

I am adding a bill photo so you can get an idea.

Aadhar Hospital, Hadapsar, Pune
Expensive hospital and bad service.

I had admitted my father just for 1 night (12 hours) for monitoring as we thought keeping him at home would be risky. If they need emergency treatment.
The next day morning we had an appointment in other hospitals.
Since they don't have ICU facility we kept them in a normal room.
For a normal room, just for one night they charged us,
10,000Rs + 1400 Blood test + Medicines and saline cost us different.

Bad Services
In oxygen supply equipment, there is a water source attached to which distilled water should be used but the nurse added water from my drinking water bottle which I found inappropriate.

I am adding a bill photo so you can get an idea. "
