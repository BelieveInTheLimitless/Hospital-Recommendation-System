5 stars,"Very well set up diagnostic center by Pune Corporation in co-ordination with Dr. Kadam Diagnostic center, Pune.

Located next to Padmavati pumping station at the junction of the Padmavati road and Satara road. It is well accessible by everyone including people with different abilities. I found it clean and well-maintained. The staff was good, co-operative and knowledgeable. The prices are very reasonable and facilities are well-equipped. The reports are delivered in time and also available digitally which is very handy. The staff called us in advance to reach in time for appointment. I would advise to go for it you will get good service and save some good amount. "
