2 stars,"Dr is very good, but admiration staff is not good specially at reception, they favour the people they know  and gives them priority and others even if they are very ill then don't care "
2 stars,"Giving 3 star for Doctor only as he was good on his part but staff was disaster sharing  issues as below :
1>No Lift so if Patient not in walking condition we have to keep him private room.
2:Tariff is very high without serving Tea also
3>staff behavior is not at all supporting they behave as if they are paid less or not paid.
4>Reception thinks OPD patient are more important than admit patients i have being kept waiting for hrs to meet Doctor .
5>for medicine of small amounts also staff sends patient attendant.
6>at midnight 2 am my father was send to get medicine of some 35 rs to medical shop.

Dear Doctor take this cases positively

thanking you

5 stars,"Doctor Ganesh Ghule is very experienced and knowledgeable. His diagnosis is very good and he identifies the health issue very accurately. He is a very polite person doing very good work @ Lotus Hospital.
With respect to OPD the waiting time is on the higher side with no appointments taken on Practo or Phone. They prefer it the traditional way wherein the patient needs to come and wait for his/her turn. Suggestion is to work with Practo so that appointment slots can be allocated which may save some time of the patients. "
2 stars,"Dr is good. Some staff is good while some nurses are not supportive. Charges are high compared to facilities, cleanliness. Do not recommend to be hospitalized. One can consult only. "

1 star,"This is so pathetic service given by doctor anjana patil,it seems she is very much arrogant.we went for a sonography purpose but the service is so bad and they charge us 1000 rupees for this type of service.The so called doctor anjana never try to speak with the patient she never tries to undestand and her face expressions are as if she is doing somekind of free treatment to us.very bad service,No understanding doctor.
