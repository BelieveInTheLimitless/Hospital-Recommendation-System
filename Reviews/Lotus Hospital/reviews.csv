5 stars,Dr Ganesh Ghule sir is one of the best doctor in pune. Reason - He was the one and only one doctor who recognised that I have been diagnosed to tuberculosis. He is so gentle and friendly and he cured me and removed out of that disease. So thankful to him he saved my life. Thank you sir. 
2 stars,"Dr is very good, but admiration staff is not good specially at reception, they favour the people they know  and gives them priority and others even if they are very ill then don't care "

5 stars,"Doctor Ganesh Ghule is very experienced and knowledgeable. His diagnosis is very good and he identifies the health issue very accurately. He is a very polite person doing very good work @ Lotus Hospital.
With respect to OPD the waiting time is on the higher side with no appointments taken on Practo or Phone. They prefer it the traditional way wherein the patient needs to come and wait for his/her turn. Suggestion is to work with Practo so that appointment slots can be allocated which may save some time of the patients. "
2 stars,"Dr is good. Some staff is good while some nurses are not supportive. Charges are high compared to facilities, cleanliness. Do not recommend to be hospitalized. One can consult only. "
