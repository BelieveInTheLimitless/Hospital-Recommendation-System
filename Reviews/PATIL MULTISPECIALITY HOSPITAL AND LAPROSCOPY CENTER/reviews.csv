5 stars,"Very good medical service provided and also it's very much cost effective, accurate diagnosis,clean surrounding, all Mediclaim bills are surely cleared and also very good trained medical doctor available 24 hour's..... "
1 star,Very slow vaccination process even though less number of people are taking here. Poor nursing staff. If you want to save hours of your precious time don't take vaccination here. They are doing inauguration program along with vaccination process. 
1 star,I come here for my wife 2nd dose vaccination. But No proper management. No proper sitting arrangements. Situations very poorly handled. Certificate issuer dont know who is giving vaccination. Payment is taken first. They offer specific tablets forcefully. 100% worst management. 
5 stars,"All the gynec and pediac issues are handeld very carefully and professionally
Charges are less as compared to other hospitals ..
Ultrasound USG is done with a high resonance machine which gives an accurate result
All the mediclaim van be claimed here easily and are passed without rejections..
These were the services by hospital which I've experienced during my gynec treatment
Dr vishwas patil is very polite and conscious about all the patients
And the hospital is working 24/7 so anyone can approach it in emergency at night without a halt "
2 stars,"Very poor management.
I went for second dose. They have taken money first and then have to wait for some time. Even they have not provided final certificate but given tablet and charged for that separately also. Hand written receipt has provided when asked for it. However, Staff was polite and clean environment. "
5 stars,"A very good service provided by hospital...
Both the Doctors...Dr pooja patil and Dr vishwas patil are polite , well educated and cooperative...Hospital staff is supporting caring..I've been felt very comfortable here while taking my treatment for gynec issues ..one must surely approach Dr vishwas patil. "

1 star,"Very bad experience. I went there with my brother for vaccination. Vaccination process was very slow and whole staff was poorly trained. They don't even know how to behave with patient's. They talk very impolitely, if u complain about anything. "
