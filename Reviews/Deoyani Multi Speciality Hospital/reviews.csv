5 stars,"For the last four years, I have been doing dialysis at Deoyani Hospital. The dialysis was covered under Mahatma Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana. I have not spent a single rupee for all my dialysis sessions. In the COVID times too, the dialysis unit was running continuously and special mention to Dr Limaye sir who has continued the unit and hospital for all the patients. The entire dialysis and the admin staff were very helpful too. The have helped us a lot for renewal the schemes and also in all our emergency situations. I definitely recommend ""Deoyani Hospital"" for all the medical treatments and other emergencies. Thanks! "

1 star,"Actually doesn't deserve even 1 star.. hopeless and ridiculous attitude of the Owner Dr Limaye and his subordinates. This HOD doesn't know there is something called as ' counseling of patient's attendees'
He is such a ignorant person and  the attitude he is carrying definitely doesn't suit a doctor...
I bet that he doesn't understand the meaning of
"" vidya vinayen shobhate ""
I.e Knowledge Shines through Humbleness
The staff in ICU and floor are equally bad. I think they even don't know that it's called ""Intensive Care Unit"".
An inferior and substandard quality hospital which gives you a miserable and pitiable experience.

5 stars,Deoyani is a good hospital in Kothrud. Few months ago my father was admitted and operated here for Bypass surgery (CABG). The surgery was successful with the grace of doctors and staff. The cleanliness maintained in the hospital was good. The staff members and doctors of the hospital was so good and Responsive. The ICU ward was great with all necessary equipments and staff's. Overall it was good experience. 
5 stars,Nice hospital with the best staff and expert doctors and peaceful environment. Do visit for best treatment 
5 stars,"Excellent Hospital & wonderful facilities. Round the clock attention to patients and relatives. Good cleanliness maintained throughout. Bell facility connected to patients bed.Upon ringing the bell, sister on duty reaches room within few seconds.Doesnt feel like admitted to hospital,due to VIP like care & treatment. Additional table for Lunch provided, which is very handy. Patient's bed has side-stands for additional support. Each hospital floor has drinking water & tea,coffee facility,which is not seen in any other hospital.Patients are treated with utmost care& sensitivity, without any hurry. Best ICU floor with good facilities for family members. "

1 star,"A real sad experience with this hospital. My father was admitted for Covid and was in the respective ward. In five days he turned negative and was shifted to a regular room. However the horrifying thing was he carried a real big pressure sore ( Bed sore ) of almost 6"" in diameter on his lower back. The floor doctors and staff were least bothered and they didn't inform us abut such a big wound. We came to know only when he was shifted to the regular room. My father didn't had a single bed sore before admission and was not diabetic neither he had any blood pressure. It's a case of negligence and poor practices where in just four days such big wound was developed. It looks like they didn't bother to change his diaper and that caused the rash and peeling of the skin. The next problem cycle started from that point. At the time of discharge the doctors didn't gave us any advise to treat the Bed Sore. Neither they directed us to any specialist. On our request one of the practicing doctors from the hospital agreed to come over and do the dressing. Things worsened after she did the dressing and the wound caught infection. They asked me to bring my father back for treatment of the bed sore. My father was there for another five days and nothing improved. A hefty bill was handed over to me again with no direction of treating the bed sore. At the time of discharge I reached out to the floor doctor saying the wound is looking real bad and is there any specific instruction ? She didn't even looked at me and said it's all right and will improve. While at home, we consulted another doctor who cleaned-up the wound and gave specific instructions about how to do the dressing and keep it away from infection. The wound started showing some improvement however the damage was done already and my father succumbed to that wound. It's the hospital that made my father to suffer in pain and and lost his life for something that we never imagined. This is a case of complete negligence and irresponsibility by the hospital and the staff. Please think before admitting anybody there. "

1 star,"Visited this hospital today for paid COVID vaccination after looking at the images online.
I choose this one because it looked neat and clean in photos. And that’s it that’s is the only reason for 1 stars otherwise I would not give single star to it.

Completely disappointed by overall experience.

The staff is rude and doesn’t know hospitality.
They don’t have digital payments options not even cards. They didn’t asked any questions for preparing patient for vaccination. Usually post vaccination medicine is provided by the center but it was not provided.
It seems the hospital is interested only in money gathering.

Govt run Vaccination center are much better than this.

1 star,"Worst experience ever......
I was recently admitted for Covid treatment at Deoyani and to even list every horrible experience I went through is going to be too much...For starters Irresponsible and untrained  nursing staff. One simple job to put saline, and they couldn't find my vein. My medicines were forgotten and exchanged with some other patient by confusion. Not only the nurses, but the DOCTORS showed extreme irresponsible behaviour as well. Naturally, because of constant steroids during treatment, my sugar shot to almost 500 and that's not the worst part. The doctor did not treat my sugar nor did he prescribe any medicine for my sugar to settle down during discharge. The pain was unimaginable. FYI I'm still struggling with my vision because of high sugar levels and it's been almost 2 weeks since this has been happening. Please be cautious and well aware before you plan to get treated at Deoyani. 😡🙏 "

All tests were done and the doctor (Dr. Vaishali Pathak) started treatment systematically. Nurcing staff, Resident doctors & Physiotherapist doctor was very supportive, soft spoken and motivating.
I had raised a few complaints during my stay about administration, but all were resolved immediately.
Finally I recovered from Covid reached home after 10 days stay but still in case of any issue Dr. Vaishali is supporting me over phone/wapp as she gets time.
Thanks to Deoyani team.

My grandmother who is 92 years old fell in the house.We called the hospital and the ambulance came within few minutes and taken to the hospital. After the X-ray, it was found that there was fracture in the hip bone. We were not sure about operating her because at this age it would be very risky but Dr.Limaye was very confident, he explained us whole situation and assured us that it will be fine.

Looking at her age, surgery was very risky and complicated but operation was successful and as promised by doctor, she will be back in before fall situation in few days.

I put the tiffin for my patient on RECEPTION COUNTER. but tiffin could not get to patient.
The hospital staff had eaten it.

When i had gone to managment that time management behavior was VERY 3RD class. They don't listen what i am saying. And just say we are not responsible for that.

This is very bad thing to take the bite of food from patient meal.

1 star,"This is one of the worst Hospital I have ever visited in Pune
I went to the Hospital with my old parents for pre Medical Health Insurance Checkup. As this Hospital is one of the registered Hospital of that Insurance company, hence I was bound to visit this Hospital.
Initially during the billing, the Hospital reception staff was rude and refused to accept the service rate chart of the Insurance company and asked us to bill as per their rate chart. We didn’t argue and paid the charges as per the Hospital tariff.
Next stage, surprisingly they have collected blood samples of my parents in casualty in a very crude way. Casualty is a place where lot of infections occur due to the visit of all kinds of Patients. How can a Hospital collect blood samples of a Health Checkup Patient in Casualty?
I am also attaching my mother’s hand image where her hand got thrombosis/ruptured during collection of blood sample by the staff of this Hospital.
<<<<<<< HEAD
Furthermore, I am also attaching one of the CBC report of my father, where there is a big mistake in the Hemoglobin value which is written as 112.9. Its Shocking….---  Did I paid so much of amount for this type of service & such type of incorrect lab reports. "
