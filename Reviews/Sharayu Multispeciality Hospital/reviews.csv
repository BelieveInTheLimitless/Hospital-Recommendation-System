1 star,"Guys don't ever go there by looking at the review the hospital is really worst, they are charging so much that any common man cannot afford there services...the staff is not qualified, the nurses don't hold any nursing degree..they are running this hospital under partnership of lady gynaecologist priyanka and Kiran bhalerao...never go there if u wanna play with life of your loves one...I would definitely take this to Twitter and other social media by sharing there bill...and would strong request respect PMC municipal commissioner sir to take audit and strick action against them...
