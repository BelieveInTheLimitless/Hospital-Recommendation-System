5 stars,"This hospital is best which I've ever seen. Dr. Rahul Birajdar Sir is just awesome. All the hospital staff is best including IPD, OPD, Reception, Sisters, Maushi, Medical shop. They take of your patient very carefully. No needs to rush for bringing medicines as they have their own medical shop in IPD area and you will get discount on all medicines. Clean and hygiene area, availability of parking, fresh and airy atmosphere. Also rates are very reasonable. I personally appreciate Dr. Rahul Sir because they explain our each and every doubts in details. Perfect diagnosis. Also they have their own pathology lab, ICU beds. Thx a lot to #TeamAnujaHospital and best wishes for future. "

5 stars,"Dr Rahul Birajdar sir and The complete staff in Anuja hospital are best. Best part which I specially like is the way they treat their patient is the best. Me and my wife spent 7 days at Anuja hospital for covid treatment but never felt that we are alone and no one is helping out. They took best care of me and my wife. Even after when my father and my brother was got affected by covid 2 months before so they both also got very good treatment from Dr.Rahul sir at Anuja hospital. All my family members are thanking you Dr. Rahul Sir and complete staff of Anuja hospital.

Thanks for all the support and care Anuja hospital has shown...! "

5 stars,"Thank you Dr. Suryakant and Dr.Rahul. Dr. Suryakant is very senior and highly experienced doctor.
Both are very accurate about their diagnosis.
My father as well as myself & my wife both are treated by Dr. Rahul.
Anuja Hospital at Dhayari is the correct choice for every diagnosis. "
5 stars,Excellent hospital. Doctors are having in depth knowledge. Documentation system is well and self driven. Entire staff is caring and attentive. I personally feel to give five out of five star rating to this hospital 
5 stars,"Recently underwent covid treatment under Doctor Rahul's guidance. It was not only for me but also for my in-law. Doctor Rahul and Doctor Suryakant were exactly knew type of treatment they want to propose.  Their simple thumb rule is that DO NOT PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS UNLESS IT IS MUST. Even for my in-law, due to age factor,  he ensured only required antibiotics to begiven for 1st seven days and based on condition,  he literally stopped all and prescribed only multivitamins. Important observation is, Doctor and nurse staff are very polite, calm, always approachable, and keep you motivating. I would strongly suggest to seek Doctor Rahul or Doctor Suryakant guidance for covid case. "
1 star,Treatment and medicine provided for kidney stone is not appropriate which will reduce paind. Also sonography was not clear. Rates are high for such sonography.

I am Mr. Dr. Sunil Prabhakar Ambike, on behalf of my family. Suryakant Birajdar, Dr. I am deeply indebted to Rahul Birajdar and all the Anuja Hospital staff for their care during my admission in the hospital.

Actually we Punekars believe in only 2-3 reputed hospitals. None of them gave us any reference to the hospital. So I was a little scared. But as it was close to home and convenient and after talking to the doctors we had confidence in them so we decided to get admitted here.

Timely care by our staff, and the cleanliness of the hospital, earned our trust. Also, due to the positive environment here, the doctors and polite and prompt sisters gave proper guidance and support to my relatives from time to time. This helped a lot in improving my health quickly. Mainly we were not rushed as all lab tests, facilities are available there.

May this vow of patient service always continue from us, this goodwill üíêüíê

your

Sunil Ambike "
