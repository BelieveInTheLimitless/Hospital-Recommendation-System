1 star,"Worst hospital ever. They take advantage of the situation to extract money from people. Receptionist has no common sense how to talk customers and patient. We did a blood test at that place for which they charged Rs. 1600, made us come and go for three days for this report.  But till the end we did not find any hard copy of it. Useless staff. "
