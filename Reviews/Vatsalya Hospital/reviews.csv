1 star,"One star is also so much for this hospital. It should be minus ratings. This Doctor she charges 1500/- for any old records if we want from her, this is purely business. rest other hospitals they charge only 200-300 rs. And she is very arrogant to speak. "
1 star,Very bad experience. Though Dr. is very senior but still she cannot diagnose my ectopic pregnancy in time. Took lot of money in the name of tests and not provided any receipt. Now she is not answering the call too. Very disgusting. I will suggest don't go for consulting. 
5 stars,"Comfortable hospital, with all amenities, good doctors and excellent work by consultants here... I could conceive after 2 years of infertility treatment and very nice encouraging treatments and counselling given by Dr Meenakshi deshpande madam, who is an expert in this field... Thank you so much  .. "
1 star,"Went for baby and Mother checkup , Dr madam (Gynac) checked both of them , took consulting charges 500 each for both mother and baby (high), Dr Sir (ped  ) not available.

Not ethical gynac should not check baby and took consultation for the same , when inquired over phone said dr (ped) is available .

Consulting charges are not written on notice board. "
5 stars,"Very friendly doctors, staff and very economical as compared to other hospitals of same type. Plus, the doctors are very senior and discuss pros and cons of each case. Good work! "
1 star,Worst Pediatrics Dr.. Do not recommend to any one. Please go somewhere else or drain your money down the toilet.
