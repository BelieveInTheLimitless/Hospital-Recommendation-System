5 stars,"Had really good experience during my hospitalization in 2021 pandemic. Hospital is well equipped with all necessary life saving equipments including emergency services. Doctors are well experienced and providing services to patients. They do have good pharmacy and supply medical needs all the time.
There was some issue with the discharge bill which was easily fixed by the concerned team without any problem. "

1 star,"Total loot!! Stay away!

Recently admitted my mother (senior citizen, staying alone) to this hospital and absolutely disappointed with their ethics and services. This hospital is purely a money making business and nothing beyond that.

Firstly, Most doctors and nurses DO NOT WEAR MASKS- this is just irresponsible and totally unacceptable.

MOST IMPORTANT: IF YOU HAVE SENIOR CITIZENS VISITING ALONE, PLZ PLZ ENSURE THAT THEY CARRY NO VALUABLE OR VERY LIMITED CASH WITH THEM. MY MOTHER GOT ROBBED OF INR 10000 FROM HER PVT ROOM AND THE HOSPITAL DID NOT CARE TO EVEN CHECK ANY CC TV FOOTAGES OR TAKE OWNERSHIP!

Charged us a whopping 28000 just for lame indigestion issue that was treated with saline and a series of tests that were performed. They charge 3000 for pvt room where the bed height is not adjustable, TV doesnt work  and cleaning is for name sake. Food is not included in the room charges and has to be bought separately from a lady who makes food. There is no check on hygiene or quality of food, I am sure.

Doctors are always rushing and always busy and barely respond to your calls. They charge for full day for a room even if the patient is admitted at 11 pm. Same is the case with the nurse and medical attendant charges. I got charged 5k for some basic meds for 3 days, 1500 per 5-minute visit by attending doc over and above all other miscellaneous charges.

The only 2 fairly good resources were Dr. Amar Raikantiwar and Nutan from the billing dept. Everyone else is absolutely useless! "

5 stars,"Good quality management, with excellent service for results so full satisfaction "
1 star,Worst Hopsital and doctors. Our patient who did go there walking .. we lost her in 2 days. Took 2+ lacks for 3 days for corona patient. 70k in advance. We bought medicine of thousands but don't know whether they were giving to our patient only. Bought plasma and paid for Remedesivir but  they did not treat our patient with that.. infection kept increasing... even Environment around was not good for patients... patients seeing others die...at last we lost her just after when we talked to doctor of moving her elsewhere... Want to sue this place but this won't make our person come back... 
5 stars,"I wish to thank each angel that was together with me in my stay in the hospital. My FATHER  told me of the effort of the emergency doctor, the nurses, and the entire team, for trying to catch me.  I saw them poorly but thanks to God, with such professional teamwork, I could and am telling it. "
1 star,Worst hospital.  No compartments/curtains in the ICU ward.  My nephew got admitted in the ICU ward.  He lost mental strength by openly seeing patients dying in this ward.  He was not well diagnosed by the doctors.  It's only money making hospital.  Finally on 21st April my 27 year old nephew passed away.  It's worst experience in this hospital 
1 star,"Patient had only stomach ache and they gave injection of vomiting & loose motion. They didn‚Äôt inform patient & also family members.They gave injection without informing us.one of the nurse who was with us she informed that we have given injection for vomiting and loose motion.so you‚Äôll be vomiting &will gate loose motion, but when we asked doctor. That why did you gave injection to the patient that they said they didn‚Äôt give it.the patient that was able to walk was not able to do anything after they gave an injection. They forcing us to do operation.
When we went for the first time.they removed sonography and x ray & gave us a wrong information that you‚Äôre abdomen is swollen. They were not get in why exactly the pain is. The next will do the sonography to check what exactly is the reason but after that they decided they should do city scan.after city scan they came to know that patient had appendix then they were forcing us to do operation but we said we do not want to do operation but still we told them that we will let you know tomorrow morning.but they said the need a signature from you to as you said know for the operation. After signing of the form they didn‚Äôt even take care of the patient. They were just ignoring and gave and without informing us they have given injection for vomiting and loose motion the patient was not able to sleep whole night.
They said that we‚Äôll give injection to stop vomiting and pain. But till the morning not the loose motion and vomiting was not stop.and they gave the injection to stop vomiting at 6 o‚Äôclock.because of them the appendix was burst so we took a discharged as they were not cooperating with us.they only wanted money.
Within two days they didn‚Äôt recover the patient but they did worstest worst condition and the patient was not able to walk as well and BP was low due to them.they added charges in the bill of anything.we not were what the charges. They didn‚Äôt inform us when we were admitted.
Even they purposely entered incorrect name of the patient all the files. We had informed them & that the name should be as per adhar card that we have given to you.they didn‚Äôt even said sorry as it was their mistake.they did bill of 12401rs for two days. They hopeless and shameless guys didn‚Äôt even do anything.as we were there for two days we came to know treating same for the other patient.
The other patient‚Äôs made the complaint of the nurse and they didn‚Äôt take any actions.
I‚Äôll never ever recommend go over there even if you are serious or sick. Money is not important but the health is important. If anyone thinks that health is important. I request you not to go there.this information is less there more bad things about the hospital.only for the name sake it is a multi-specialist hospital. "
1 star,"Very very bad experience,  want to give minus star. They make you afraid first, and then tell to admit into ICU. Don't go ever there. If you want to save money and life "
1 star,"At 1st they told us that our patient is covid negative and after consulting more than 5-6 specialist doctors they told us that the patient is covid positive.
After the late realisation and due to improper treatment we lost our patient.

Worst treatment and management.
Careless staff and uneducated doctors. "
5 stars,"I m really greatful to the doctors of this hospital. Special thanks to Dr.Vaibhav Patil who was God in disguise and helped in giving a bed for my mother who was covid positive. Dr. Amar Raykanti he was another angel üòá who got my mother cured. Just saying thank to this hospital is a smaller statement I wish there was something bigger than thanks, I will always recommend this hospital to all. Thanks once again to Silver Birch üòäüôè. Wishing silver birch mangalmay üôè and indeed 100 stars "

1 star,"The experience of this hospital is very bad our patient was admitted for 3 days but the patient did not make any difference doctor was not checking the patient in the visit
This hospital is a condition where pain is one thing and treatment is another. When there is a mediclaim policy, the bill is increased by admitting patients only to increase the bill.
Later, when our patient was taken to another hospital, our patient recovered in 3 days "
1 star,"This hospital does not treat patients of Kovid 19 (Corona). Corona patients are treated along with other patients in this hospital. Isolation ward is not available for corona patients. Corona patients are kept with other patients. No staff/doctor use mask in hospital. Doctors give answers and reasons that don't fit with common sense. Emphasizes how to maximize billing without treating the patient as physical progress. If the patient is important to you, don't even by mistake get admitted in this hospital. This opinion is based on my experience. Not one-sided like other reviews.

Translation :

This hospital facility is not for Covid-19 (Corona) patients. All Covid-19 patients are treated as pneumonia patients on record and the treatment is given for covid. Covid patients are kept along with other patients there is no isolation ward for Covid. Covid-19 test is not at all conducted for the patient and without any proper conclusion patient is given Covid treatment. Treatment is not given as per the recovery rate of the patient. They just try to stretch your bill as far as they can. The staff and the doctors are not at all skilled. The staff as well as doctors don't use masks. The Doctors don't give you any information about the treatment/ patients recovery progress. The reasons given by the doctors are just like dialogue of movie Munna bhai MBBS without any scientific reasons. If your patients life is important to you then please don't admit him/her here. All the positive reviews are biased here. I have personally experienced this hence given this review. Rest is your choice. "

1 star,"Our patient died due to negligence at Silver Birch Hospital. If the doctor there had already done the covid-19 test, our patient would have been twelve. The life of the rest of the patient in the ICU ward room could be at risk because of the unsanitary and lack of proper precautions! "
5 stars,"For the 1st time in Dhairi village, there is no such good big hospital and such a good facility anywhere. Today when I went up to the hospital, I was very tense but in about 1 to 1:30 hours I was totally tension free. Thanks to Doctor Tarange sir and all his fellow doctors and all Staff class "
