5 stars,"The best hospital that I have ever experienced. Shashwat Hospital, Kothrud strongly believes that quality is never an accident, it is always the result of high intention, sincere efforts, intelligent direction and skillful execution. We have experienced the greatness of this hospital. My father had undergone bilateral total knee replacement surgery with the great, magical and skilled hands of the best orthopaedic surgeon Dr. Hrushikesh Saraf. He is the God for all of us. He gave courage to my father and boosted his confidence to undergo surgery. My father was not able to walk a single step and climbing a staircase was next to impossible for him. Now he climbs staircases of three floors, walks 2/3 kilometers, and goes to the vegetable market by walk to buy vegetables (age 70). This is really a miracle for all of us. Before surgery, walking a single step was very painful for my father. Every day, after getting up from bed, he praises Dr. Hrushikesh Saraf Sir.  About Shashwat, Hospital, Kothrud, we were there for four days. All staff members from group D to Group A are highly cooperative and caring, and with emotional attachment towards the patients and their relatives. We were outsiders, came from Solapur for Surgery. My mother, me and my brother were accompanying my father in the Hospital. The staff cooperated to the best possible extent. We never felt that we were at a Hospital. Great doctors, great team of supporting staff and the great Hospital! "
1 star,"Security guards do not work at all. They just stand in corner and laugh at your problems. Today while purchasing surgical material, another patient cane near me.. He had smoked.. He could have gone to another window for clearing his bill but no. I requested him twice in polite manner, yet he started shouting in abusive manner. I had to shout twice. Yet security and no one else came to my rescue. In fact, I was cornered by the two security people and that smoker. I had to run away.
Veru cheap facility from all aspects. The medical shop, the working ladies and the casjier.. All are unthinkable. No help. "

1 star,"Amruta Vaidya, OPD manager of Shashwat Hospital Kothrud branch today presented the rudest, ugliest and most unprofessional face of a front desk manager in a hospital. One would expect the person sitting in this position to be honest to his/her job and diligent in sequencing the patients on a first come first serve basis (which is this hospital’s stated policy despite seeking prior appointments). However on highlighting the error she made in granting the token number, she blatantly said that she saw the other person (who cut the queue) first, and didn’t see me even though I was diligently standing in the queue! Even after narrating the true position she denied accepting her folly!
Her tone and facial expressions indicated that she was indispensable for the hospital management, and no one could harm her position even if complaints are made at whatever level in the hospital management.
The decline of a healthy organisation starts with its customer facing personnel treating its clientele in an indignified way!. Hospital management should remember that, it’s the visiting doctor’s who make the hospital successful, and such ill treatment to patients at the OPD opens up for them to seek advise from other establishments!
If the management still supports its arrogant staff behaviour, then God save the establishment!!🙏🏼😡

Single star for not being able to rate lower for the pathetic administrative experience offered by this place. "

They don't care how patient feels, even in ICU they don't take good care..they just want to have tea n do laugher... Hopeless people ..in Marathi we say bhikarchot loka.. this is the typical word for them. We went to this hospital just for dr.bhat .. I had huge respect for him. But he also doesn't boughter to tell relatives what is the actual state of patient n more of doesn't give enough time to talk.
Never ever prefer Shashwat hospital. Don't follow the reviews where they say they r nice n all .. just don't go to this hospital "

1 star,"I would like to share my close relative's experience with the General Physician (name withheld).

My relative had lost her husband few months back and since then she was having difficulty with eating and sleeping and with daily activities in general. We booked an appointment and the consulting  charges were payed.

Our relative was the last patient before close of business, the doctor came in and my relative explained her ailments to the doctor. He was pretty poker faced and showed no facial expressions. Mechanically, he gave some prescriptions and asked to conduct some tests, my relative started explaining things about her loss and how she has sleepless nights most of the times, as she was telling, the doctor appeared completely disinterested in her talk. Whats more, he started fiddling with his mobile phone without even acknowledging our presence there.
My relative asked why he is not listening to which he replied that he was done for the day and asked us to leave.

I have met a lot of doctors, some even strict in their demeanor, but I had not seen a doctor who was so self-absorbed that he would not listen to his patient so far.
I might agree that my relative was talking something that was related to her loss but not to her ailment, but to be completely dismissive of the person sitting in front of you is discouraging. Any other person with a common sense would calmly dissuade the patient from going off-topic (given her situation) and ask them come back later with a smiling face. From a business perspective, if we are paying hefty consulting charges, the least that we can expect from a doctor is professional behavior.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I don't think I will ever be going to the hospital again. The consulting charges are not worth the doctors that are present there. The General physician there is a heartless man who is a bad listener and has general lack of empathy. The only good part is the medical store that is open 24 hours at a prime location. "
1 star,"Only been to OPD and management is worse, they take too much time to even prepare a bill, absolutely no transparency in patience OPD numbers, staff is arrogant. No use of taking appointment as they do what they want. OPD has inadequate sitting arrangement. Cleanliness is poor. Doctors are good that's only plus point "
1 star,"This is a covid vaccination centre, highly mismanaged and utterly disorganized was it!!!, No queues, no number checks whatsoever. Government hospitals are much better. When questioned about this chaos, the person managing queues shouted at us. Very very poor experience I must say "

1 star,"Very Bad Experience from staff belongs to Sonography department specially Prajacta.
They have asked to pay amount first even though not sure about if they will be able to provide me service or not even after asking 2-3 times.
Didnt refund amount, very informal behavior, disconnected call on my face and didn't take responsibility as per commitment.

Doctors are good but staff is pathetic.
Don't even guide new patient correctly.

If you have no prior experience of sonography or any other x rays and all.... Don't prefer this.

Arrogant staff, insufficient nurses. From a glass of water to medicine you need to arrange and pay, their job is to prepare bill.  Lot of people might have seen hospital as i but no one can see worst hospital that this. "
4 stars,"We usually visit Shaswat Hospital for my son's consultation with Dr. Sanjay Natu. We have always found him to be soft in nature, listens to us thoroughly, and suggests us only necessary tests & medicines unlike most others in this profession. We are very happy with Dr. Sanjay Natu's services.
Then another doctor - Gynecologist Alka Ranade is also very affectionate in nature, greets us as if we are guests and we found her diagnosis, prescriptions and treatment good.
But then our opinion about rest of the hospital staff starting from the rececption in ground floor or the reception in top floor or the ones in the medical shop are very sharp, abrupt and some times even blunt.
That is why I am giving just four stars instead of five. "
1 star,"Very bad experience. Doctors and staff don't have coordination with each other. They suggested to get admitted, but they are not sure about if the room is available, and if not when it will be available. Before getting admitted we went for OPD but we waited till 2 hours without any reason, after checked by one doctor they asked to consult other doctor for same reason, I dont know why. Even their path lab dont have B12 report facility, u need to wait till 3 days to get the report, and till that time they ask you to get admitted, unnecessary salines and injections. "
1 star,"The worst hospital i ever saw in my life.just money matters more than patient.A lack of care and compassion, such as staff not doing enough to ensure the patient was comfortable.
Staff not keeping patients well informed. Inadequate response to requests or complaints.Long waits before or between appointments. "
1 star,"bad experience. refused for cashless claim despite having insurance partnership. no updates given to relatives.
Dr.ranade did not answer any of our questions. Directly took for operation. During the course, noone from the staff was giving information. They said doctor knows and the doctor disappeared after operation. "

1 star,"Google mandates to provides starts otherwise no stars.

Pathetic money oriented hospital I came across, they are pretty much into money business than descent service.

I met with an accident so had to visit the doctor, then I realized it was fracture. first of all at Billing they have only 1 card swipe machine, unnecessary one has to wait, no good token system to allow patients to docs.

Now, the dco's part, he is Ortho, on 1st floor, soon I went in to show him the injury, without even thoroughly checking asked me to have X-Ray, which confirms ( as per him ) minor fracture, I got plaster applied and asked to visit after 1 month. ( just to apply plaster Jr doc charged 2000, excluding material)

when I visited after 1 month, waited long at billing counter to get appointment, soon I entered into doc's cabin, he asked Jr doc to remove plaster and again sent for X-Ray (500rs), ##### here it comes, mistakenly I showed him the older X-Ray, he said ""See recovered"", I was shocked and same time angry on him, then I showed him second (new ) X-Ray, he was trying to spin the subject, that time I lost complete trust over these docs.####

don't understand why docs are so much after money ??? "
3 stars,"Becoz a hospital needs to be visited to be cured, it’s sad to observe the apathy of how it’s managed. Surely a noble deed of its founders but the noble profession at this level surely needs to ACT upon improvising hygiene and basic amenities for its patients.
There is awareness but possibly the will to do what it takes is missing. "
1 star,"Badddd experience! Do not go here atall!! I am giving a star cuz without that review cannot be written. Then staff is untrained and unprofessional. They do not understand the condition of the patient and yell at them. They have zero sensibility. My relative, who was an icu patient and had undergone a major surgery, was taken over the steel strecher on a very very unsmooth path of stones and pebbles in the hot sun from one building to another. The staff basically doesn't care that they have been employed to look after unwell people! "

All this while we were calling and following up but the staff here was least bothered to tell us anything.Finally were asked for refund which was denied and they asked us to come back after 7 days to collect cheque. I was from mumbai so it was not possible for me to come back. Really horrible service and poor policies and attitude of staff.

1 star,"Pathetic! Whole time Dr. Saraf was into his mobile chit chatting over whatsapp while consulting me. Just like a money making machine, he prescribed some meds after what he calls ""checking"" my ankle and sent me out, all this hardly 2  in minutess. Never seen such a careless doctor! "
1 star,Poor management... Less staff... Illiterate nurses... Nobody is to look after... Dont expect discharge on committed time... Doctors call patient 4 hours befor the operation unnecessarily waste of time... Pathetic experience

I had gone to this famous hospital after a fall from bike, with chest pain,,,, I was x-rayed there,,, One Dr. Saraf just looked the X-ray for a second, and said everything is fine, you have no fracture, and wrote some tablets,,,, but as I had no relief from pain, after  10 days I went to another Doctor with the same X Ray,,, after carefully observing, he told that 2 of my Chest Ribs are fractured and suggested Chest Belt,,,
Due to wrong judgement of the Doctor, I suffered acute pain for several days,,, will never go to this hospital again. "
3 stars,Nice facilities and staff behavior.The doctors were available contrast to some hospital where they come in specific time slot.The only problem was they gave many medicines unnecessarily because we take medicine from there medical shop.

4 stars,"Good hospital with good consultants (Doctors) attached to the hospital. Though the hospital is open for 24 hours, check individual Doctor's OPD days and timings with the hospital before visiting. Calling before visiting is recommended. "
1 star,"Pathetic! Whole time Dr. Saraf was into his mobile chit chatting over whatsapp while consulting me. Just like a money making machine, he prescribed some meds after what he calls ""checking"" my ankle and sent me out, all this hardly 2  in minutess. Never seen such a careless doctor! "
1 star,Poor management... Less staff... Illiterate nurses... Nobody is to look after... Dont expect discharge on committed time... Doctors call patient 4 hours befor the operation unnecessarily waste of time... Pathetic experience 
1 star,"Very Much Uncaring &  Negligent attitude by the Doctor,,,,,
I had gone to this famous hospital after a fall from bike, with chest pain,,,, I was x-rayed there,,, One Dr. Saraf just looked the X-ray for a second, and said everything is fine, you have no fracture, and wrote some tablets,,,, but as I had no relief from pain, after  10 days I went to another Doctor with the same X Ray,,, after carefully observing, he told that 2 of my Chest Ribs are fractured and suggested Chest Belt,,,
Due to wrong judgement of the Doctor, I suffered acute pain for several days,,, will never go to this hospital again. "
3 stars,Nice facilities and staff behavior.The doctors were available contrast to some hospital where they come in specific time slot.The only problem was they gave many medicines unnecessarily because we take medicine from there medical shop. 
1 star,"Horrible experience !
They are just fooling people. Doctors don't want patients to be cured at the earliest. They just want you to come again and again. "
4 stars,It's  a good hospital with all types of care
