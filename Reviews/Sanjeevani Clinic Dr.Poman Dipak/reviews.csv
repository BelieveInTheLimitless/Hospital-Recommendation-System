5 stars,"My whole family was tested positive ! As Dr. Poman already our Family Dr. He guided and consulted through outly the full process and precautions. As per the report and minimum infection he suggested us for the Home isolation keeping in mind with each of us health he gave us the treatment accordingly,While isolation period he used to take the folllw up even if we missed to share the vital information with him. He even supports whenever you call without any irritation. He have supported us mentally and positivly.Due to heavy cough and infection to my father, we had to move him to hospital, in that situation Dr Deepak poman helped as a lot. in our overall covid positive journey I don't think we would have found anyone better than him to look out.

Also I would like to mention about Dr Bhakti Poman, Who Gave us Ayurvedic medicine for cough and all which effect was too good and without any side effects

Thank you for reading the Review and I hope it will help you any way it can. we will definitely recommend Dr poman for this.

5 stars,"I'm Sagar Bhandari (age 33). Myself and my mother (age 63) detected covid positive. We were extremely terrified by this and not knowing how to get treated. But then we came to know about Dr. Dipak Poman and Sanjeevani clinic from our family friend. When we contacted Dr Poman he gave us the most right picture of our covid stage. Doctor asked us to perform few blood tests and based on the results doctor asked us not rush to hospital as our treatment through home isolation was possible. Doctor gave us enough time to discuss our mental and physical condition. Doctor was contacting us by himself which was really heartfelt. We followed the treatment as prescribed and after 14 days isolation we were fine. Our O2 level was improved and we felt fit. We thank you Doctor Poman for his treatment and guidance through our toughest times so far.
Thank you Doctor! "
